    Dribble: This refers to bouncing the ball on the floor using one hand at a time while moving around the court. It’s the primary method of advancing the ball and maintaining control while moving past defenders.
    Pass: Passing means throwing or handling the basketball to a teammate. It’s an essential skill that allows players to share the ball and create scoring opportunities. Various passes exist, including chest, bounce, and overhead passes.
    Shot: A shot refers to an attempt at scoring by throwing the ball toward the hoop. There are different types of shots, including layups, jump shots, hook shots, and dunks.
    Rebound: A rebound occurs when a player gains possession of the basketball after a missed shot. You have both offensive rebounds, where the team that shot the ball gets another attempt to score, and defensive rebounds, where the opposing team regains possession.
    Block: Blocking is a defensive technique where a player prevents an opponent’s shot from reaching the basket by jumping and hitting the ball away with their hand or arm. Getting it right requires timing, athleticism, and interpreting the opponent’s moves.



    Baseline: The baseline, also known as the end line, refers to the boundary lines at either end of the basketball court. They are located behind the baskets and mark the points where the court ends.
    Sidelines: The sidelines are the boundary lines on the sides of the basketball course and mark the outer edges of the playing area. Players with the ball must stay within the sidelines during gameplay.
    Center circle: As you might expect, the center circle is a circular line at the center of the basketball court. It’s used for the tip-off, where one player from each team jumps for the ball to start the game.
    Free-throw line: The free-throw line, also known as the foul line, is located 4.57 meters away from the backboard and parallel to the baseline. It’s used for free throws, which give players an attempt to score points without defensive interference after they’ve been fouled.
    Three-point line: The three-point line, (also referred to as the arc or the perimeter), is a line that forms an arc-shaped boundary around the basketball court. It’s located 7.24 meters from the basket in the NBA, and baskets from beyond this line are worth three points rather than two.

    Screen: A screen, also called a pick, involves a player standing in the path of a defender to impede their movement and create an advantage for a teammate. The player setting the screen uses their body to block the defender, leaving their teammate free for shots and passes.
    Pick-and-roll: This technique, also known as a screen-and-roll, involves one player setting a screen (pick), allowing his ball-handling teammate to escape the attention of the player guarding him. The screener then moves (rolls) toward the basket to make himself available for a pass.
    Isolation: Often referred to as iso, this strategic play occurs when a player faces a defender one-on-one without much involvement from other teammates. Their teammates clear out a side of the court to give the player space to maneuver and make their shot.
    Cut: A cut is when an offensive player without the ball quickly changes position on the court. It involves making sharp, purposeful movements, often towards the basket or to an open area, with the intention of receiving a pass.
    Alley-oop: This exciting offensive play is where one player throws a pass toward the basket, and another player catches it mid-air and dunks or scores before landing. Getting it right requires excellent timing, coordination, and athleticism.



    Man-to-man defense: Man-to-man defense, also known as individual defense, is a strategy in which each defensive player guards a specific opponent. The defensive players are responsible for staying close to their assigned attacker, preventing them from getting open and blocking their shots and passes.
    Zone defense: This strategy involves assigning specific areas or zones to defend instead of specific players. Defenders will guard a designated zone on the court, aiming to disrupt passing lanes, block shots, and force opponents into difficult positions.
    Press: Short for full-court press, this strategy involves aggressively applying pressure on the attacking team’s players as they try to advance the ball up the court. Defenders often guard the opposing players closely, attempting to force turnovers and disrupt their play.
    Trap: This defensive maneuver involves two defenders converging on an offensive player to force a turnover. It usually occurs near the sidelines or in a corner of the court. The defenders work together to close off passing options, apply pressure, and encourage mistakes.
    Steal: A steal is when a defensive player takes possession of the ball from an opponent without committing a foul. It typically happens by intercepting a pass or dislodging the ball from the offensive player’s possession.



    Dunk: A dunk refers to a basketball shot in which a player forcefully throws the ball into the basket using one or both hands. It occurs when a player is close to the basket and jumps high enough to reach the rim.
    Swish: A swish occurs when a player successfully shoots the ball, and it goes into the basket without touching the rim or the backboard. Its name comes from the “swishing” sound of the ball hitting the net.
    Airball: An airball happens when a player attempts a shot, but the ball completely misses the rim, the net, and the backboard, resulting in the ball going out of bounds or being collected by the opposing team without being touched.
    Brick: A brick is a shot attempt that hits the rim or the backboard. It usually implies that the shot was unsuccessful and lacked accuracy, resulting in a “hard” rebound off the rim or backboard.
    Hoop: The term hoop is a common synonym for the basketball rim or the entire basket, which includes the net, rim, and backboard. You’ll often hear people use the expression “shoot some hoops” to mean play basketball.
