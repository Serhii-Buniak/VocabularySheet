    Fresh ginger roots, 4-5 oz. [115-140 g.] (if you cannot find fresh ginger, use ginger powder)
    A large heavy pot with a lid. The pot should hold at least 1 gallon of liquid, and should keep its contents hot. An enamel pot is preferable.
    One gallon of water
    A grater (a porcelain grater is preferable)
    One large, thick bath towel
    Two or three smaller cotton kitchen towels
    A small cotton bag or old sock, which can be closed tightly by string or a thick elastic band. Make such a bag and use it solely for preparing ginger water.
    Rubber gloves

Applying a ginger compress:

    Place the grated ginger in a cotton bag, or old sock, and squeeze out the ginger juice into a pot containing 1 gallon of hot water kept just below the boiling point (if you boil, you will lose the power of the ginger).
    Dip a towel into the ginger water (preferably a 100% cotton towel), wring it out tightly and apply (very hot) directly to the area to be treated.
    A second, dry towel can be placed on top to reduce heat loss. Apply a fresh hot towel every 2-3 min. until the skin becomes red. Complete duration for the compress should be about 25-30 min.



    Many types of acute or chronic pains, such as rheumatism, arthritis, backaches, cramps, kidney stone attacks, toothaches, stiff neck, and similar problems can be relieved using a ginger compress. If the pain worsens during treatment, you should discontinue the process.
    Ginger compress can speed up the improvement from a variety of inflammatory conditions like bronchitis, acute or chronic liver inflammation, prostate infection, bladder inflammation, intestinal inflammations (never appendicitis), boils and abscesses.
    To relieve congestive conditions like asthma.
    To dissolve hardened accumulations of fats, proteins or minerals. Examples are kidney stones, gallbladder stones, cysts and benign tumours such as uterine fibroids.
    To dissolve muscle tensions.
    When tissues have been damaged, ginger compress can speed up the regeneration of the damaged area. 
    In after treatment of broken bones.

Counter indications:
Ginger compress is very contractive (yang); they are hot applications. It would be wrong to apply a ginger compress on areas and in situations characterised by contraction, dense, compact (yang).

     Never apply a ginger compress to the dense, compact brain-area.
    Never apply a ginger compress on a baby or on very old people.
    Never apply a ginger compress on the lower abdominal area of a pregnant woman.
    Never apply a ginger compress on an inflamed appendix (appendicitis) or on a lung affected by pneumonia (conditions generated by the consumption of contractive foods; meat, eggs, poultry and cheese).
    Never apply a ginger compress when a high fever is present.
    Never apply a ginger compress for more than 5 min. on a cancerous tumour.


        For some acute problems (such as stiff neck), often one treatment per day for 2-3 days is sufficient.
        For acute problems accompanied by attacks of pain (such as kidney stone attack), application can last for hours.
        For acute problems such as a bladder inflammation, we must treat 2-3 times per day for several days.
        For chronic problems such as cysts, the compress should be applied every day for several weeks, even months, in a row.
        For chronic problems such as weakened organs (for instance chronic liver problems), we can apply compress for 3-5 days, then interrupt several days, then apply again for 3-5 days, interrupt, and so on…

This tea is useful for the intestines, especially in cases of diarrhoea. It strengthens the digestion, increases vitality, and relieves general fatigue. It is also useful in cases of appendicitis, laryngitis, or whooping cough a slight fever (not more than … Continue reading →
