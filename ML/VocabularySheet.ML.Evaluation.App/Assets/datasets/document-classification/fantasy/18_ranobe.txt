Leo immediately turned to the other side and saw a bunch of members coming in from that side. He could sense 15 people rushing in from there. They had all heard the sound from the earlier Flame Burst.

Since the group that was coming in from the other side was not expecting the magic attack, none of them put up any form of a shield, and all of them were directly hit by the Flame Burst. None of them survived. They were a total of 7 people who got caught up in the attack.

The latest Flame Burst created enough sound for the new group to be completely on guard. Even though a lot of them were very drunk, they still put up shields when they walked in. When they got there, they didn't see anyone. All they saw were the leftover burnt corpses.

Leo had shadow stepped to the other side of the hallway. There were only 8 people left on that side and it would be easier to deal with them than the other 15 people at once. Also, he was on the side that was the closest to the staircase.

If any of the members needed to go down to warn the rest of the members that they were being attacked, they would have to go through him.

When he suddenly appeared in front of the group of drunk members, they all instinctively put up Aura Shields. Instead of trying to break through the shields, Leo went behind them using another Shadow Step. Their shields only covered a portion of their bodies and their backs were completely unprotected.

He threw a Flame Burst at them and Shadow Stepped back to the front. He didn't have a lot of time, but he still had priorities. He was going to loot the pouches of the group he killed initially. The Flame Burst already did its job with the second group and killed all of them as well.


Leo unleashed a massive Flame Burst at the ceiling of the hall. The explosion brought down the chandelier hanging there to the ground. The ceiling started to rumble and cracks formed where the ceiling used to hang.

The cracks slowly intensified and the members noticed that. Most of the members jumped away from where Leo while a few moved toward him. A lot of the Apprentice Aura Knights didn't know what was happening so they stayed in their place.

The ceiling came crashing down and the first floor caved into the ground floor. The ceiling was already burning because of the fire from the first floor. The Flame Burst just hastened the process of its crashing.

Once the smoke cleared, Leo shot a Magic Bullet at the sole Apprentice Aura Knight there. He was outside the radius of destruction from the beginning but on the wrong side of the chandelier. The man dropped to the floor.

He looked at the members that were unlucky enough to be on his side of the hall. The other side was completely blocked off. He looked at the members who were sweating when they saw him. They were facing off a mage that was so clearly stronger than them so they didn't want to start the fight.

"Do you want to live?" He asked them.

They nodded. None of them dared to speak. There were only 5 of them, and all of them were 1st Circle Aura Knights.

"Then scram. Tell the people on the other side that I will let them go if they leave now," he said. He turned away and left the hall.

A Flame Burst flew toward the leader. The man instinctively blocked the Flame Burst with his left hand. The ball of fire blasted into the left hand before the leader could even muster any aura. Leo immediately took a few steps back and waited for the smoke to clear out.

The leader immediately circulated aura through his body and repelled all the flames clinging to his body. He roared.

"Who attacked me?!"

His left arm was completely blown away. His right hand was still holding on to the sword sheath. His eyes were red from the pain, but his roar was more from the anger. He bit the sword sheath with his teeth and pulled out the sword.

Another Flame Burst flew toward the leader. The leader countered it very easily with a slice of his sword. The ball of fire was cleanly split into two halves that flew in separate directions before hitting the walls.

Leo slowly started backing away to the open area with the pool. He wanted to give himself space so that he wouldn't have to fight a close ranged fighter in a small space.

"Who are you?" The leader asked again. This time he was calmer. "What is a mage doing in the slums of a small city like Solhaven?"

Leo thought about whether he wanted to answer the question or not. Suddenly, he realized that they weren't alone. The room that the leader came out of had three other people. One of them, a woman, had come out and was looking at both of them. She was in earshot of the conversation.

"I am Orion. I am from Eldridge. I came here because... I was bored." Leo came up with the answer that made the most sense. Mages were more likely than not nobles. Nobles only interfered with commoners when they had some interest in the matter. They didn't have any morals or anything. Not as far as he knew.

The leader clenched his teeth. "Is there anything I can do to relieve that boredom? I have many friends who can perhaps accompany you for the night." He suggested.

He just lost his arm to the mage, but he still had to be respectful. If he attacked the mage, he would be attacking a noble. If anything happened to a noble, the magistrate would get involved. For the magistrate, killing him would be as simple as snapping a finger.

"No. Not really." Leo said. He threw another Flame Burst at the leader. The leader blocked it again.

"Sir, I am going to have to defend myself if you keep attacking me!" The leader said. He was starting to get frustrated that he couldn't do anything.

Leo took a few steps back. A cornered animal was the most dangerous. He needed to give himself some time to calm the leader down. Leo still held the advantage. The leader was losing his temper and he was down a hand. Also, he had no idea that Leo could Shadow Step behind him at any time.

He hadn't yet because he was waiting for the right time. And the right time came very quickly.\


"Of course, you don't," The leader shook his head. "This was my life's greatest masterpiece. I was going to finally raid the Valkyr's Forest. And you ruined it. My plan that I was chasing for years was destroyed by a bored mage."

The leader started chuckling. Meanwhile, Leo was confused. "These many people to raid the Valkyr's Forest? What is there that you need these many Aura Knights?" He asked curiously.

The leader was still chuckling. "You would like to know, wouldn't you? Let me tell you. There is an urban legend that has been passed in Solhaven. A legend that the Valkyr's Forest holds the inheritance of a great person. A mage named Valkyr."

For a second, Leo thought that the leader was talking about the tome he received, but he didn't think that was it. Even though it was likely, he had also heard this urban legend. He knew that the story said what the inheritance was and it wasn't a tome.

"You are going after an urban legend?" He provoked the leader a little more to find out more.

"Yes. And it's not a legend. This inheritance exists." The leader said.

"Why are you telling me this? Aren't you afraid I might steal this inheritance?" Leo asked the leader.

The leader smiled. "You think you are so powerful. But both you and I know that you are just a kid. A kid that happens to be a 2nd Circle Mage. Let me guess. You broke through a few days ago and wanted to flaunt your strength so you came to this city. Well, let me tell you a reality. Even if you got me by surprise and took away my arm, you can't win this fight. And since I told you all this, I will make sure that no one else will know."

After saying this, the leader swung his sword at Leo. Leo sensed a huge amount of danger from the leader. He instinctively put up an Elementary Arcane Shield. The sword was covered with aura and the aura left the blade and launched toward him.

The aura hit his shield and shattered it. The force knocked Leo two steps back.

"You can take a hit. I am surprised you defended that. But how long can you keep doing that?" The leader asked. He swung his blade again. It looked very effortless for the leader, but in reality, he was using all his strength in each of the swings.

Meanwhile, Leo was getting beaten back. Each time, his shield would barely block out most of the force and he was taking a little damage each time. He was going to eventually run out of energy and the damage would accumulate.

The leader was also getting tired and Leo knew this. That was why he was waiting. The leader was slowly closing in and Leo let him close the distance. Eventually, the leader came so close that he was 5 meters away from Leo. He lifted his sword to swing at him.

Leo knew that this was his moment. Every time that he had defended against the sword swing, he used an Elementary Arcane Shield. If he used the same thing this time, he would not be able to defend the swing. Both he and the leader knew that. However, the leader was so used to only attacking the Arcane Shield that he assumed Leo didn't have a better counter.

Leo immediately Shadow Stepped behind the leader and attacked him with a Flame Burst. The leader was so surprised that his target disappeared in front of his eyes. He sensed the attack behind him, but he was slow in turning around. The Flame Burst hit his back and exploded.

Leo had purposefully led the leader to believe that he did not know any other spells other than the shield and the Flame Burst. He had kept the leader unaware that he could dodge every one of those attacks so that he could use it to sneak attack him. And it worked marvelously.

The leader was left on the floor. He was still clinging on to his life, but he couldn't move. Leo crouched down at a safe distance from the leader and started to talk to him.

"Well, if it helps, I'm not a noble. I'm just a commoner like you. Except I have morals in my life. I'll look for the inheritance you told me about. Thanks for the information." Leo said. He got up and looked at the still leader. He pointed his hand at the head of the leader and cast a Magic Bullet.

The leader had no energy to muster any aura to defend himself. Even if he did, it would be pointless. He was going to die regardless.

After killing him, Leo grabbed his pouch. He was guessing it would be a lot more important than the members and would have a lot more money. He opened the pouch and saw there wasn't anything in it.

He clenched his fist and let go. He realized that the leader didn't put the money on him, which meant it was somewhere in the mansion. He already burned down the part where the members lived, but the leader's quarters were very intact.

Leo looked down at the body and saw something shiny on the leader's neck. He leaned closer and saw a key hooked to a necklace. He immediately grabbed the key and pulled it out of the chain with a strong pull. The key probably unlocked some sort of safe.

Leo sighed. Now he had to look for the safe in the leader's quarters. This was going to be a lot of work that he would need to get done in only a few hours. He still had to get back before Daphne woke up.

He went to the mansion and grabbed the bag that he had set aside on the way. He walked to the room that the leader came out of. He was going to search in the most obvious place first.



Leo entered the room that the leader had come out of. It was a bedroom that had an adjoining bathroom. The room was very large and spacious, with a large bed in the middle of it. There weren't any closets or tables anywhere. There wasn't anything out of place and the only attraction was the bed. However, his sense could detect that something was weird about the bed.

He decided to move the bed to see if there was anything wrong with it. When he tried to do that, he immediately realized that the bed wasn't as ordinary as it looked. Even though he tried to move the bed, it refused to budge. He tried again, using a lot more force, but the bed didn't move at all.

He sighed and activated his body-strengthening magic. He tried to push the bed again and saw that the bed was almost moving, but it still didn't move away from its spot. He looked out of the window and saw that it was dark outside. He still had a lot of time left so he could try to figure out what was wrong with the bed.

Or he could just brute force his way out of the ordeal. He cast a Flame Burst on the bed, blowing it up into smithereens. When he did that, the entire wooden body of the bed flew everywhere, but the base of the bed stayed. It was a metal base that was built into the floor.

As the fire burned the mattress away, Leo noticed that there was a trap door below the mattress. That was why he couldn't move the bed. The base of the bed that he was trying to move was part of the floor, so it was held by a lot of metal. He was trying to move the entire floor at the same time. He was supposed to just lift up the mattress to uncover the trap door.

Either way, he got the job done. He opened the trap door and looked at what was below it. The trapdoor opened to a staircase that led down. This was the first time he had seen this staircase even though he had explored the mansion a few years ago after the Thorn Roses had left it. He was very surprised to see it.

He went down the staircase quickly to move out of the lingering flames. The flames were going to die out quickly because they didn't have anything to burn on, but they were currently burning on the wood framework of the bed.

He went down the staircase and entered a room. It was a study with a desk in the center. There was a shelf with a lot of papers, but Leo was more interested in the book on the desk. It was the ledger of the Blacktooth Gang.

He quickly opened it and saw heaps of loan information and payments that the Blacktooth Gang received. There were so many of them that Leo started to realize just how big the Blacktooth Gang was. He was surprised that no one did anything about it.

He went to the final page and saw a number that shocked him. The Blacktooth Gang had 3 million Starcoins in liquid cash and everything else in the form of loans. He wasn't going to do anything about the loans, but free money was always welcome. He suddenly realized that he would actually have to find the money to keep it.

He looked around for clues. He had a key, but he needed to find where the key went into. He walked to the other side of the desk and sat on the chair there. He looked around from the chair for possible locations for a safe.

There was nothing that he could see. Eventually, he looked down at the drawers of the desk. He opened them up to see if there was anything in them. The first one that he tried to open didn't open. He looked closer and saw that it was locked. The keyhole to the lock was a similar silhouette to the key he had.

He put the key in the keyhole and unlocked the drawer. When he opened it, he found a single ring there. He felt so frustrated that he wanted to punch the desk into smithereens. He took a deep breath and calmed his teenage mind down.

He picked the ring up. It was a gold ring and had nice engravings on the inside of it. The minute he picked up the ring, the tattoo of the tome on his hand glowed for a second through the clothes. It was very brief, and when it ended, Leo suddenly found the information about the ring in his mind.

The ring wasn't a normal piece of jewelry. It was a dimensional ring. It could hold objects within it without weighing anything. The items would be stored in another dimension. Dimensional rings are crafted by mages that were at least at the 5th Circle. They would go for several tens of millions of Starcoins based on how much they can store.

Leo pricked his finger and poured a drop of blood on the ring. That was how he was supposed to claim ownership of the ring. When he did that, he slipped it on and could suddenly sense the insides of the ring.

Inside the ring was a multitude of cash and various other objects. The total space was a cube with a side of 10 meters. It was a lot of space, which meant that the ring was very expensive.

All the cash that was mentioned in the ledger was in the ring. He could see multiple notes, and when he counted them all out, they added up to a little more than the 3 million Starcoins. He tried taking them out of the dimensional ring, and they were neatly stacked up in his hand.

He smiled. He quickly took out the pouches that he had from the bag. He emptied them out one by one and slowly put all the money there into the dimensional ring. The ring would be incredibly useful to him and help him when he would go hunting in the forest. He would also not have to carry a pouch anymore.

When he finished transferring all the money to the ring, he started going through the other items in the ring. They were just a few papers that showed the recruitment levels of the Blacktooth Gang that looked very boring. One piece of paper that did stand out was an old parchment rolled up neatly.

He took the parchment out of the ring and looked at what it was. It was very frail and he felt like it would tear if he used too much force to open it. He unfurled the parchment to reveal a map. He looked to see what the map was for. When he found it, everything the leader said made sense.

The map was the reason why the leader believed that the Valkyr's Forest lead to an inheritance. The map showed the way to where the so-called inheritance of Valkyr was located. It marked the spot in the center of Valkyr's Forest. It was a treasure map.




Leo glanced at the treasure map before putting it back into the ring. He wished he could go immediately and find whatever the map was leading to, but he couldn't. Valkyr's Forest was dangerous because the Inner Forest was filled with 2nd Circle Magical Beasts.

That was only the Inner Forest. The center of the forest would definitely have a 3rd Circle Magical Beast. And this wasn't even considering the recent change in Valkyr's Forest. If there was indeed a Beast Wave that would happen in the near future, there were chances that the Magical Beast could be a 4th Circle Magical Beast.

Once he had everything sorted, he got up and went to the pool. It had been 3 hours since he had come to the mansion, and the destruction he had caused was tremendous. Half of the mansion was burnt down and the Blacktooth Gang was completely gone.

After making sure that the fire wasn't going to spread anywhere else, he left the place to go back to his house. He got back and quickly went to sleep. He would have a long day the next day and wanted to be in his best condition for it.

He woke up the next day to a loud knock on his door.

"Come in!" He said. He slowly got up from his bed while Daphne entered the room.

"Why are you still sleeping? We should go to the festival today!" She said excitedly.

The festival was an annual New Year's celebration that the city had. He had been to the ones before and they were fun as long as you had a little money to play some of the games there. He had always saved up enough to play them the years before this, but now he didn't have that problem.

"I'll get ready. Don't worry." He said. He yawned while getting up to get ready. "You go outside. I"ll be out in 30 minutes.

He quickly got ready and they both set out to the festival. It was early in the morning, but they were planning on spending the entire day there. The day went by incredibly quickly, and the night approached.

As it did, the streets started to get bright with lamps and colorful lights. Everyone was enjoying their time. Leo and Daphne were also having a fun time. Eventually, the crowd started clearing out and they all went back to their homes. Both of them also went back.

When they got back, they were exhausted. Before she could go back to her room, Leo stopped Daphne.

"Wait," he called her. She turned back.

"What?" She asked him.

"Happy birthday," he said. He didn't have any gift in his hands, but he wanted to wish her.

She smiled. She leaped into him and hugged him. "Happy birthday to you too!" She said.

She was only turning 13 while he was now 14 years old. They were still incredibly young, but they had always been that. Every year that went by, they got more mature and more stable.

"Okay, now we should sleep. We'll see if we can go do anything tomorrow." Leo said. He didn't have anything planned, but it was the New Year. He was going to start off with some fun and then go back to training.

The next day, the two of them went to get lunch at a nice restaurant. After that, they went back to their house and the celebrations died off. Daphne went back to her room while Leo left the house again.

He was going to the Thousand Treasure Tower. He had gotten so much money and so he had to use a lot of it. He was only planning on buying one item for the day and saving the rest for a later day.

When he got there, he went to buy the Aura Gathering Pill. He was finally going to start learning how to use Aura. Ever since he became a 2nd Star Mage, he was able to see the aura that Aura Knights use. He was able to detect it and understand its flow.

He hoped that this experience would translate to actually gathering aura and being able to use it. If he could do that, then he would no longer have to hide his magic as much and use Aura instead.

He bought 5 Aura Gathering Pills. The money came solely from the money he raided from the members he killed. They had a decent amount of money themselves since it included normal gang members as well as higher-level members.

He stayed even after purchasing the pills to browse through any interesting materials. He looked at the items that were on display and he realized that there wasn't anything on that floor for mages.

Everything there was for Aura Knights. He realized that he would have to go to the floor above for items that would actually help him, but he couldn't do that since the qualifications to enter the first floor were that he had to be a 2nd Circle Aura Knight or be a noble.

He decided to leave and go back to his house. When he reached the house, he didn't start training immediately. He wasn't in a hurry to become an Aura Knight yet. Instead, he went out to the inn that he normally went to.

This was because he needed information. The entirety of the previous day, he had spent time with Daphne. That was why he didn't know what information about the Blacktooth Gang actually spread out.

He needed to know out of curiosity and because of his own involvement. When he got to the inn, he could hear a lively noise from the inside. When he entered, he saw that the adventurers and mercenaries were all partying.

He was curious and went to the front. He saw the owner was incredibly busy serving a lot of beer to the customers. He saw Leo and stopped his work.

"Hello, Leo! How are you?" Miller greeted him enthusiastically.

"Hello, Miller. I'm doing good. How about you? Why is the inn this lively today?" Leo asked him.

"Oh, this? I gave everyone here a free beer on the house. Today is the New Year. And we started this year with such wonderful news!" He said.

Leo could already guess where this was going, but he still had to ask.

"What happened?"

Miller smiled widely. "A Mage from Eldridge came and wiped out the Blacktooth Gang. Now, I don't have any more debts left. All thanks to that noble person. I would give them a big kiss if I could see them."

Leo cringed inside but kept a smile on the outside. "That is such good news! Good for you. But why would a mage come to Solhaven?" He asked.

"I don't know. Now that you've mentioned it, I never actually though about that. Why was he here?" Miller went deep into thought.

"Okay, I'll see you around!" Leo waved and left the inn. He didn't get any food because he did everything he wanted to.

All he wanted to do was plant the thought of why the mage was there. Once Miller asked the adventurers, someone would start making rumors. Eventually, there would be enough rumors about the mage that everyone would think this person definitely existed.




Leo got back to his house and finally got some time to train. He had a busy week for the past few days and now he was ready to do what he had been trying to do for almost a month. He was finally ready to train his Aura.

He quickly got ready to start his training. He was going to hole himself up in his room until he at least detected aura. He first decided to wait on the Aura Gathering Pill and just try gathering aura by himself.

He closed his eyes and focused his mind, attempting to sense the aura that surrounded him for a second time. He was eager to experience it for himself. Unlike magic, which was so natural to him, aura was different.

Magic was the power that let him harness the elements of nature. That was why it seemed like it was a part of nature. He felt it was more abundant in the forest and less abundant in the city.

On the contrary, the books that taught him aura said that it was the energy that flowed through all living beings. It was the power that let a person harness their own power to the fullest capabilities.

When he sensed magic, he had seen colorful particles that represented the various elements of nature. However, the aura that he had sensed in Daphne and other Aura Knights was different. It was an energy stream that flowed around their entire body and originated from their dantian.

He tried to look for this mysterious energy once more. When he did, he could see the magic that surrounded him, but this magic was so bright that he couldn't see any aura. This was the main reason he wasn't able to train in aura. His affinity with magic was proving to be his downfall.

He took a deep breath and decided to take one of the Aura Gathering Pills. When he did, he suddenly realized why the pill was so effective. It didn't help in sensing aura. The pill itself had Aura hiding in it. When he took the pill, he immediately sensed a stream of aura flowing out from the pill and entering his body.

He quickly tried controlling the stream of aura. The minute he tried to force it into his dantian, the cool stream of aura suddenly changed its nature. It turned into a hot blazing force that started to burn his insides.

He quickly let go of control over the aura and the burning sensation stopped. He quickly decided to just keep the aura inside his body by circulating it around his body while thinking about what to do to the aura.

So instead of forcing the aura into his dantian, he just circulated the aura throughout his body, letting his muscles soak in the cool, pleasant sensation of the aura. As he did that, he slowly fell into a trance. He stopped trying to think about trying to control it and just let it flow through his body.

As he did that, he felt he was getting more and more attuned to the energy. As time passed, the flow of energy started to slow down. Eventually, he could feel that the aura had lost all of its previous wild nature.

He tried controlling it again and guided it into his dantian. This time, the aura listened to him and slowly entered his dantian. The aura congregated at the center and he could finally take a breath.

He let out a breath of air that was filled with stress and tension. He was very worried when he felt the burning sensation in his body, but his quick thinking saved him from too much pain.

He opened his eyes and saw that a lot of time had passed. When he had fallen into the trance, he had completely lost his sense of time. The sun had already started rising, which meant that he was training for almost 8 hours.

He got up to take a quick refresher. He walked around a little before sitting back on his bed. He had made a lot of progress in the 8 hours that he had trained. He had sensed aura, which was the first and most important step in training in aura.

After taking an hour-long break, he went back to training. During the break, he went outside to grab some food and saw Daphne. Since he saw her once, she wouldn't bother him for several hours. He quickly sat on the bed and grabbed another pill from his dimensional ring.

Before eating it, he tried sensing the aura again without the help of the pill. He was hoping that since he had aura in his body, it would be easier to sense it. He was wrong. When he tried sensing aura again, he was once again overpowered by the magic in the air.

He sighed and popped the pill into his mouth. It was the only way he could actually train in Aura for now, but at least it worked. He started circulating the aura around his body again, letting it soak into his muscles.

By the end of the day, he had gone through another pill. He only had two pills left. However, the progress he had made was enormous. He had reached the Peak-Stage of the Apprentice Aura Knight. The only thing left for him to do was form his first Aura Circle.

However, he wanted to be careful when doing this. He realized very quickly that the amount of aura he had in his body wasn't normal. He was only an Apprentice Aura Knight, but the amount of aura he had was the same as Daphne.

Daphne was a Middle-Stage 1st Circle Aura Knight. The difference between her and an Apprentice Aura Knight was supposed to be unsurmountable. However, he had taken 3 Aura Gathering Pills without forming his 1st Circle.

This meant that his body needed more aura to break through. He didn't want to start breaking through until he bought a few more Aura Gathering Pills and see if there were any better pills that might help him break through.

Before doing any of that, he wanted to test if the amount of aura also meant that he could do the same things that Daphne could do without having a circle.

The next day, he went to the Thousand Treasure Tower to answer all these questions he had. However, when he got there, he saw that there were a lot more people there than normal. The place was entirely packed.

He moved closer to the tower to see what the issue was. As he got closer to the crowd near the entrance, he saw what was different. There was a huge board above the entrance.

It was only a temporary board, but it was extravagantly decorated. On it, were a few dates.

[Annual Treasure Auction]

[7th January, 8th January]

It was the information pertaining to an auction that was being held there. Normally, that wouldn't mean anything to Leo, but now he had enough money to buy something he could actually use there. He would also be able to experience an auction. He quickly went to the front to get more information. While he was trying to squeeze through, he saw a familiar figure.


In the distance, he saw the girl who was with the Magistrate going into the tower. He quickly scoured the place to look for the Magistrate. He didn't want to stay near a person who could see through him that easily.

When he scanned the area, he realized that there wasn't anyone stronger than a 2nd Circle Mage or Aura Knight in the area. He breathed out a sigh of relief. The strongest person there was a Peak-Stage 2nd Circle Mage that was right beside the girl.

He guessed that the mage was her guard while the Magistrate was away. This meant that the girl was someone he could not afford to offend. After waiting for a while, he walked into the tower. Since the girl probably went to the first floor, he would be fine on the ground floor.

He entered and went straight to the purchasing counter to ask for some information.

"Hello, how can I help you?" The receptionist asked him.

"Hi, can you give me information about the auction?" Leo asked her.

"Yes, of course. Can I have your card, please?" She asked him. He handed it to her, and she took it to the back. She came back and handed it to him before talking again.

"The auction is on the 7th and 8th of January. Are you here for someone, or..." She asked him. Looking at his young age and appearance, she assumed he was running an errand for someone.

"I'm asking for myself," he said. He didn't mind that she was assuming. He expected it.

"Oh. You need to show that you can pay for all the purchases that you have made, so only accounts with more than 1 million Starcoins are allowed to participate in auctions. Anyone who does can request a free copy of the items appearing on the auction." She said. "Unfortunately, you only have 3 thousand Starcoins in your account, so you aren't eligible to participate."

"So if I put in a million Starcoins, can I participate?" He asked. She nodded.

He took the card and went to the counter where he normally deposited cash into his card. He had done it numerous times and was experienced in it. He took out a pouch that he had on him to mask the use of the dimensional ring.

He pulled out the money from the pouch and deposited a million Starcoins in his account. He took his card back and went to the same person.

"Hi, I deposited some money. Can you please check and see if it's enough?" He asked her.

She took the card with a begrudging look and checked the balance on it. When she did, she was so shocked that she almost dropped the card. She handed the card back to him with shaky hands.

"Yes, sir. You have enough money to participate in the auction. Do you want to hear the next steps to participate?" She asked with a more subdued tone of voice.

"Yes, please." He said with a huge grin.

"I can have you registered for the auction, so you can come in on the day of the auction and proceed to the auction hall. You are in the General Buyer Section. You can collect your paddle on the day of if you show your card there." She informed him.

He nodded. "Thank you for your help," he said. "Can I get the items that appear on the auction?"

"Of course," she said. She quickly scrambled to the back and brought a nicely decorated book. She handed it to him and he left.

The reason she became so respectful was because a million Starcoins was a lot of money. Only the wealthy commoners and the nobles could have them. This typically meant having a 2nd Circle Person as a member of the family. And a 2nd Circle member was essentially a Powerhouse in a small city like Solhaven. There were around a thousand of them in a city of 70000 people.

Leo was more special because he was so young and had this much money. It meant that he was part of a huge family. Even though he said he wasn't there on behalf of someone, she assumed he was from a big family.

Meanwhile, Leo was facing his own set of problems. He was just walking out when he encountered the girl who was with the Magistrate. She had also come down the stairs at the same time that he was leaving the tower. He didn't know why she was using the commoner's entrance.

Aurora saw him and recognized him from a few days ago. Unfortunately for him, she approached him. The person guarding her also approached him with her.

The girl had light blonde hair and green eyes. She was an apprentice mage based on what he sensed from her. She looked the same age as him, so he assumed she was. She was dressed in a very fancy coat and she looked like she was in charge. Her demeanor showed that she was a noble.

The person next to her was a young man in his twenties. He was dressed in a military uniform with a crest pinned to his chest. Based on the gazes of contempt he gave the commoners who passed by, Leo guessed he was a noble.

"You. What's your name again?" She asked Leo.

"Me? I'm Leo. What's your name?" He asked her. He tried to be polite, but his use of language quickly showed the difference between the two.

"Lady Aurora, why are we wasting your precious time like this? Is this boy an eyesore to you? We can have him removed." The man said.

Even though he could, Leo stopped himself from blowing up the mage in front of him. He was angry that the person thought he was that expendable, but that was just how nobles were.

"No. My grandfather liked this boy. I thought it would be interesting to actually converse with him," she said. She had a more formal tone of voice than the last time he saw her. It was probably because she was with a different person.

'"As for you, I'm Aurora. Nice to meet you," she said. She didn't curtsy, but she took his hand and shook it. Leo could immediately see the person behind her was getting angry at this.

"I'm sure that you have more important things to do. Why waste your time on me?" He asked her.

She frowned a little. "What are you implying? Are you implying that I cannot dictate how I use my time?" She asked him.

"No, of course not. I was just..." he trailed off. He didn't want to trap himself. He was trying his best to decrease the interaction he was having with her.

She looked back and saw that her guard was getting impatient. She smiled at this.

"Mr. Redback. I don't want to keep you waiting here. How about I have a meal with my friend here while you take care of any business you have?" She said to him.

The man became flustered. "I can't do that Lady Aurora. The Lord Magistrate assigned me to protect you from-"

"There aren't any threats that I will face. I can handle myself." She said.

While this conversation was happening, Leo internally killed himself a few times. Why did he have the worst luck possible?

Razé had become a 2nd Year student of Centrior Imperial Magical Academy.

The 3rd Year students had graduated and went on their chosen career path. The newly enrolled 1st Year student had brought with them a new fresh feeling. Razé and Folia had moved to Alisa and Mary’s room. Their original room was currently occupied by new juniors. This time, it was their turn to look after the new girls.

Razé had lost a little weight again during the long winter holidays, but she knew that she would gain the weight again after eating the delicious meals at the school.

Carna and Folia had asked her out during the holiday, but she had turned them down again. She was determined to join them on their next holiday by whatever means necessary.

Carna: “Razé!”

Razé: “Carna-sama. Good morning.”

Razé was reading a book in the classroom while sitting at the same seat as last year. Carna walked up to her with an excited look on her face. “Look at this. I thought maybe we could hold a school festival this year.”

Zale: “I want you to make sure that she won’t be disturbed by people with bad intentions. Of course, I’m not asking a favor for free. I’ll help you after you graduated.”

Razé was impressed with his words. It showed how much influence he had in this society.

Razé: “I won’t need your support. Folia is my friend, so I don’t any compensation.”

Zale looked surprise, and then he muttered to himself, “Just as expected from Folia.”

The meaning behind it should be: “Just as expected from Folia, she knows how to choose friend wisely.”

And so, Razé took the responsibility as Folia’s bodyguard to keep away those guys who were trying to approach Folia.

< < <

I’m sorry, Ian-kun.

Razé knew that Ian was walking right behind them. She apologized to him in her heart while carrying the documents with Folia.

Folia’s love interests should have started to notice about her crush by now. It was easy to guess from how frequent she had been visiting the chapel lately. Razé felt sorry for those guys.

But honestly, Razé was unsure whether these guys had any feelings towards Folia since most of the romance flags were not triggered. From her observation, the one that undoubtedly has feelings for Folia was only Luca.

Ian: “Razé-san, let me carry that for you.”

Razé did purposely take over the event, but her eyes widened when Ian had called out to her.

Razé: “Oh, but-”

Ian: “I can’t let a girl carry heavy things.”

This was a standard characteristic for a love interest in an otome game. Razé was unsure whether his action was caused by the heroine presence nearby, or because of his own personality. But she was taken aback by this gentleman attitude.

He will become a good man in the future.

Razé felt that she didn’t have to worry anymore because she was sure that he would be able to meet a nice girl. Otherwise, she definitely would suffer from guilty conscience.

In that case, I’ll find a nice girl for him!

When she worked in the Military Intelligence Department before, she had made many social connections. If she put some effort on it, she would be able to find a lady that matched him well. Razé gave a cheer to Ian in her heart.

Folia: “Oh, I forgot. Razé-chan!”

Razé: “Yes?”

Folia: “Are you free this Sunday?”

Razé: “I think so.”

Folia: “Great! Let’s go out on that day.”

Folia’s angelic smile made Razé forgotten all her worries.

Razé: “You’re not going to the chapel?”

Folia: “Oh. Hmm. It should be fine.”

Razé: “Hmm?”

Razé felt a bit surprise but didn’t think too much about it. She entered the classroom used by the Steering Committee and saw Carna clearing up some papers on her desk in a haste. Razé felt a bit curious but she assumed it was something that couldn’t be shown to Folia so she didn’t say anything about it.

Carna breathed out a sigh of relief when she saw Razé’s normal reaction. She went to Folia and whispered to her, “How was it?”

Folia: “She’s free. I’ve made promise to go out with her. It’s perfect!”

Carna: “Alright. The preparation on my side is going well too.”

Both of them looked at each other and nodded their heads.

Razé: “I’ll bring this document to Murton-sensei.”

Carna: “Thank you, Razé.”

Razé: “Don’t mention it. I’ll be back soon.”

After confirming that Razé had left, Carna took out the papers that she had hidden earlier.

Carna: “Listen everyone. We are going to celebrate Razé’s birthday this year.”

Folia: “Yay!”

The papers were the party plan for Razé’s birthday. Razé herself had forgotten about it because her personal record was fake, but this Sunday would be Razé Granoli’s birthday.

Claude looked at the list of plans and asked, “Surprise party? You’re doing such an elaborate plan?”

Folia: “Yes. It’s to celebrate for this year and last year. We want to surprise her.”

Carna: “I didn’t know her birthday last year. By the time I found out, it had already passed.”

Carna sighed as she thought of her mistake. After the Star Festival last year, she had asked Razé about her birthday and was surprised when she found out that it had already passed.

Folia: “Razé-chan is indifferent about herself.”

Carna: “I think so too. I’m pretty sure she’s not aware how famous she is among the male students.”

Folia nodded her head when she heard Carna’s words.

Folia: “But she seemed to be aware that people are always looking at her.”

Carna: “Really? That’s a surprise.”

Folia: “Razé-chan said that those people are interested in her because she’s a scholarship student and she thought that they wanted to make connection with her for future prospects.”

Carna: “…I see.”

Carna knew that Razé had always acted aloof, so she could understand her words.

Adis entered through the door and said, “But it could be the truth, don’t you think?”

Carna felt annoyed by his words. “Maybe the original intention is like that, but Razé is cute, you know.”

Adis: “…Hmm.”

As a ladies’ man, Adis wouldn’t say that Razé was not cute, but he felt that there were many pretty girls other than Razé.

Carna: “She’s hardworking and has good grades. Although she was not good at fighting, she looks cute when she holds a sword with her small figure[1].”

Adis assented perfunctorily as he sat looking unconcerned. He might look like a player, but he was very serious with his work. He ignored the chatting and concentrated to do his work efficiently.

Carna: “Hmm. If Razé put on some make-up, I think she would look very cute.”

Folia: “She always helps me with my make-up. It doesn’t seem like she doesn’t like make-up.”

Carna: “Hmm. She’s just being indifferent about herself.”

Carna thought for a while and then added some notes on the party plan.

Carna: “Razé will be the main star this Sunday.”

The classroom was filled with peaceful atmosphere as Carna laughed happily.

Leo, a young orphan in Solaria, had an incredibly powerful affinity for magic. He didn't even know about it because he could never learn magic- he was too poor to try and learn from any magic academies. He was just trying to survive the streets of Solhaven until he found the lost tome of the Arcane Emperor.

The white lotus, a legendary artifact rumored to contain the very secrets of the soul, granted its wielder otherworldly power. Countless powerful Magi from all across the universe waged an epic battle over it.

When the dust settled from their fierce clash, the artifact disappeared, awaiting to be inherited by one with great destiny.

Adam dreamed of breaking free from the grip of poverty, yearning for a life of riches and comfort. Yet, in a world ruled by arcane spellcasters, achieving such a dream meant becoming one himself.

However, learning magic was an expensive aspiration. Not only did it require talent, but also vast resources, neither of which he had. 

"What you do in life, Echoes in Eternity."

The System, who goes by the code name, Thirteen, defied the System God in order to give his previous Hosts’ the chance to change their Fates.

Unfortunately, he was killed by his Father, the System God, and was sent to the world of Pangea to struggle like the Cannon Fodders that he fought so hard to protect.

Armed with his knowledge as a System, Thirteen vowed to change not only his Fate, but the Fate of others whose destinies were tied up with him.

In a world torn by power and corruption, a fallen System will bring out a symphony of change, or lead it to its destruction.



“Otherworlders… we beg you to save our world from ruin.”

However, Rey decides to invest all his Karma on a single Skill, leaving him with the weakest Class.

Unknown to everyone, though, he has the potential to be the strongest.
