If you took a snapshot of the sun at the same time each day (from the same location), the Sun would make a figure shaped like an analemma during the course of a year (this is because the Earth is tilted on its axis and because it doesn't orbit the Sun in a perfect circle).

map
A map is a graphic representation of a place. There are many different types of maps that have different uses. Since a map is 2-dimensional representation of a 3-dimensional world, compromises must be made. Different maps differ in the relative accuracy of the depiction of the area, the shapes of objects, actual distances, and compass direction. Maps that accurately relect area are often called equal-area maps (an example is the Albers equal-area conic map). Maps that maintain the shape of objects are called conformal. Maps that correctly show the distance between areas are often called equi-distant maps (note that the shortest distance between two points on a map is generally not a straight line. but a curve). Navigational maps need accurate compass directions maintained on the map (like the Mercator map). 	

map projections
There are many ways of making maps. Since a map is a 2-dimensional representation of a curved surface (a globe), the map cannot be perfectly accurate. These map-making methods are called projections because cartographers have to project a 3-D surface onto a 2-D map. There are many different types of projections that have different uses. Some projections preserve compass directions but distort areas (like Mercator projections), while others preserve area but distort distances and compass directions (like Robinson projections).
