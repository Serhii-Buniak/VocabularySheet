fall within its exclusive competence the Union shall act only if
and insofar as the objectives of the intended action cannot be
sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level
or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the

SPECIFIC PROVISIONS
Article 39
Specific provisions for implementing common foreign and
security policy
1. The European Union shall conduct a common foreign and
security policy, based on the development of mutual political
solidarity among Member States, the identification of questions
of general interest and the achievement of an ever-increasing
degree of convergence of Member States' actions.
2. The European Council shall identify the Union's strategic
interests and determine the objectives of its common foreign
and security policy. The Council of Ministers shall frame this
policy within the framework of the strategic guidelines estab-
lished by the European Council and in accordance with the
arrangements in Part III.
3. The European Council and the Council of Ministers shall
adopt the necessary European decisions.
4. The common foreign and security policy shall be put into
effect by the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and by the
Member States, using national and Union resources.
5. Member States shall consult one another within the
European Council and the Council of Ministers on any foreign
and security policy issue which is of general interest in order to
determine a common approach. Before undertaking any action
on the international scene or any commitment which could
affect the Union's interests, each Member State shall consult the
others within the European Council or the Council of Ministers.
Member States shall ensure, through the convergence of their
actions, that the Union is able to assert its interests and values
on the international scene. Member States shall show mutual
solidarity.
6. The European Parliament shall be regularly consulted on
the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and
security policy and shall be kept informed of how it evolves.
7. European decisions relating to the common foreign and
security policy shall be adopted by the European Council and
the Council of Ministers unanimously, except in the cases
referred to in Part III. The European Council and the Council
of Ministers shall act on a proposal from a Member State, from
the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs or from that Minister
with the Commission's support. European laws and European
framework laws are excluded.
8. The European Council may unanimously decide that the
Council of Ministers should act by qualified majority in cases
other than those referred to in Part III

Specific provisions for implementing the common
security and defence policy
1. The common security and defence policy shall be an
integral part of the common foreign and security policy. It shall
provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on
assets civil and military. The Union may use them on missions
outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and
strengthening international security in accordance with the
principles of the United Nations Charter. The performance of
these tasks shall be undertaken using capabilities provided by
the Member States.
2. The common security and defence policy shall include the
progressive framing of a common Union defence policy. This
will lead to a common defence, when the European Council,
acting unanimously, so decides. It shall in that case recommend
to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in
accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall
not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence
policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations
of certain Member States, which see their common defence
realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, under the
North Atlantic Treaty, and be compatible with the common
security and defence policy established within that framework.
3. Member States shall make civilian and military capabilities
available to the Union for the implementation of the common
security and defence policy, to contribute to the objectives
defined by the Council of Ministers. Those Member States which
together establish multinational forces may also make them
available to the common security and defence policy.
Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their
military capabilities. A European Armaments, Research and
Military Capabilities Agency shall be established to identify
operational requirements, to promote measures to satisfy those
requirements, to contribute to identifying and, where appro-
priate, implementing any measure needed to strengthen the
industrial and technological base of the defence sector, to
participate in defining a European capabilities and armaments
policy, and to assist the Council of Ministers in evaluating the
improvement of military capabilities.
4. European decisions on the implementation of the
common security and defence policy, including those initiating
a mission as referred to in this Article, shall be adopted by the
Council of Ministers acting unanimously on a proposal from the
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs or from a Member State. The
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs may propose the use of both
national resources and Union instruments, together with the
Commission where appropriate.
5. The Council of Ministers may entrust the execution of a
task, within the Union framework, to a group of Member States
in order to protect the Union's values and serve its interests.
The execution of such a task shall be governed by Article III-
211.
6. Those Member States whose military capabilities fulfil
higher criteria and which have made more binding commit-
ments to one another in this area with a view to the most
demanding missions shall establish structured cooperation
within the Union framework. Such cooperation shall be
governed by the provisions of Article III-213.
7. Until such time as the European Council has acted in
accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, closer cooperation
shall be established, in the Union framework, as regards mutual
defence. Under this cooperation, if one of the Member States
participating in such cooperation is the victim of armed aggres-
sion on its territory, the other participating States shall give it
aid and assistance by all the means in their power, military or
other, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
Charter. In the execution of closer cooperation on mutual
defence, the participating Member States shall work in close
cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The
detailed arrangements for participation in this cooperation and
its operation, and the relevant decision-making procedures, are
set out in Article III-214.
8. The European Parliament shall be regularly consulted on
the main aspects and basic choices of the common security and
defence policy, and shall be kept informed of how it evolves.
Article 41
Specific provisions for implementing the area of freedom,
security and justice
1. The Union shall constitute an area of freedom, security
and justice:
— by adopting European laws and framework laws intended,
where necessary, to approximate national laws in the areas
listed in Part III;
— by promoting mutual confidence between the competent
authorities of the Member States, in particular on the basis
of mutual recognition of judicial and extrajudicial decisions;
— by operational cooperation between the competent autho-
rities of the Member States, including the police, customs
and other services specialising in the prevention and detec-
tion of criminal offences.
2. Within the area of freedom, security and justice, national
parliaments may participate in the evaluation mechanisms fore-
seen in Article III-161, and shall be involved in the political
monitoring of Europol and the evaluation of Eurojust's activities
in accordance with Articles III-177 and III-174.
3. In the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal
matters, Member States shall have a right of initiative in
accordance with Article III-160 of the Constitution
