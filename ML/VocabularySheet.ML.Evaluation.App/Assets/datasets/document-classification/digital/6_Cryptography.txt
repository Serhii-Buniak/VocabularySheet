Cryptography Glossary

Algorithm: A procedure that is carried out in sequential steps to solve a problem.

Attack: An attempt to break into a cryptosystem.

Authentication: The process of verifying information including identity, ownership, or authorization.

Back Door: A cipher design fault that allows access to a system who discover the secret.

Blind Signature Scheme: Scheme that allows one party to have another party sign a message without knowing the contents.

Block Cipher: Encrypts data in blocks.

Certificate: An electronic document provided by Certifying Authorities that binds information that identifies the owner with a public key.

Clipper: An encryption chip developed by the US government to be used in all encrypted communications. It would allow the government to “listen in” after obtaining a warrant.

Cryptography: The method of making information secure.

Decryption: Term for extracting information that has been encrypted.

Digital Fingerprint: Similar to digital signature.

Digital Signature: The value that provides authentication in an electronic document.

Distributed Key: A key that is divided into several parts and shared with multiple participants.

Encryption: Term used to define hiding information in a secret cipher.

Expiration Date: Date when a certificate or key expires.

Forgery: Data item with content that misleads the recipient into believing it came from a different source.

Key: A string of bits that allows someone to encrypt or decrypt data.

Key Schedule: In a Block Cipher this is the algorithm that generates the subkeys.

Key Space: A collection of all the possible keys for a cryptosystem.

Life Cycle: How long a key can be used and still provide adequate security.

One Time Password: A password that can only be used once.

Password: A key in the form of a word or group of characters that allows the user to access an area that is secure.

Plain Text: Data to be encrypted.

Random Number Generator: A device or algorithm that generates a sequence of numbers that has no set pattern.

Reusable Password: A password that can be used repeatedly.

Running Time: How long it takes for a specific algorithm to run as a function.

Salt: An arbitrary value that is attached to a password before hash authentication, that is unique to a specific user.

Secret Key: A crypto key with a symmetric algorithm that is used for both encrypting and decrypting the same data.

Server: A computer that provides services to other computers, or a software program that provides a specific service to client software running on that computer or others n a network.

Session Key: A key that is used only one time for a single session or message and then is discarded.

SKIPJACK: The Block Cipher that is in the Clipper Chip.

Sniffing: An attack that copies the content of network messages to obtain information such as passwords.

Splitting: The process of dividing a crypto key into two parts so that the key can’t be reconstructed if an attacker intercepts one part.

Symmetric Cipher: Ciper that uses the same key to encrypt as well as to decrypt the data.

Transmission Control Protocol: Internet protocol that is used to provide a reliable connection between a server and a client.

Transport Mode: ESP mode that encrypts the data but not the original IP addresses.

Tunnel Mode: ESP mode that encrypts data and IP addresses.

Vernam Cipher: The original cipher that was developed to encrypt teletype traffic, patented in 1919.

Vulnerability: Weakness in security that could allow an opponent to attack and penetrate a cryptosystem.

Wide Area Network: A group of host computers and sites that are connected across a wide geographic area through a network.


Encryption process terms	Explanations
Add guardpoint with Policy

	The workspace is about to be encrypted. Access to the workspace is temporarily restricted so nothing can be added or removed during the encryption process.
From this point forward, when files are added to the encrypted workspace, they're encrypted.
Delete pending guardpoint with Policy 	The restriction that prevents access during the encryption is removed.
Marked guardpoint pending delete with Policy 	The workspace is encrypted.
Decryption process terms	Explanations
Delete pending guardpoint with policy
 	Access to the workspace is temporarily disabled. Nothing can be added or removed during the decryption process.
Marked guardpoint pending delete with policy

	The workspace is about to be decrypted. The  policy that allows access to the workspace will be removed. This allows the data to be safely decrypted.
General Terms	Explanations
Asymmetric cryptography	Also known as public key cryptography. This method uses public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The key that is exported from Anaplan is the public key of the pair and the algorithm used is RSA 2048. This will be used to wrap a symmetric key.
Create symmetric key	An Encryption Administrator creates an encryption key in BYOK.
Symmetric cryptography	Uses the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plain text and decryption of cipher text.
Update key	An Encryption Admin updates the reminder date of an encryption key in BYOK.
Wrapped key	An AES-256 symmetric key wrapped in an asymmetric key generated within Anaplan.
