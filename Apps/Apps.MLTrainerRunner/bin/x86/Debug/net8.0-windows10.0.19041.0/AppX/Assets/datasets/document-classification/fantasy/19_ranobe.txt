"Varian!"

Kyle waved at him and approached him in rapid steps. Varian stood stupefied as Kyle reached him and …

"What the fuck are you doing here?" they both yelled at the same time.

Varian glared at his friend "You are taking the entrance to Military Science Academy. So why are you in the fucking Abyss? You are a non-combatant for fuck's sake!"

Kyle glared back with equal intensity "And you never told us you were going to Defense Academies. Are you out of your mind? The minimum requirement is to kill Level 2 Abyssals! You're only a level 1. They'll rip you apart."

They both stared at each other and finally sighed in union.

Kyle confessed in distress, "The Management is nuts. We, the candidates for science academy, had a written test. The ones who passed the test are dropped in the Abyss. As long as we "survive", they'll take us in. We'll spend our lives in labs. Why test us with this goddamn Abyss?"

Varian patted Kyle's shoulder and said, "Just stay away from the city. There are villages a few kilometers from here."

He sighed at his own plight "I… might sound crazy, but I really, really need to get into Imperial Academy."

"They won't pick a Level 1. You must at least be Level 2." Kyle rebutted.

"So I have to breakthrough to Level 2 before the test ends." Varian shrugged.

Kyle looked at Varian like he was a madman. Varian awakened just a few days ago and now he wanted to break into Level 2.

He would've written it off as drivel if it was someone else, but looking at the burning fire in Varian's eyes, Kyle felt maybe his friend really believed he could do it or… that he must do it despite any price.

"Good luck, bro. I'm sorry I can't help you out." he smiled at Varian.

"You...you are that got lucky and didn't die, right? You were also at the Supervisor's office earlier. I must have thought why did a nobody like you appear there." Narcis uttered with contempt and disdain as he recalled his encounter with Varian.

Narcis never remembered the names of people below his own status. Varian was the only one who bumped into him three times and made him uncomfortable thrice.

"Science students, we have a briefing." An announcement interrupted the tense movement, and Kyle waved at Varian and slipped off.

Before he left, he whispered, 'This is a campus, don't worry. You'll be alright.'

Varian knew that fighting on campus wouldn't be overboard and he'd be safe, but he still wanted to beat Kyle.

'I swear I'll pay back.' He vowed.

"Are you going to bully an awakener at a level lower than you?" Adir stepped up and blocked Narcis's path.

"Do you really dare, Adir Caron?" A blue light flashed from Narcis's heart and covered his body.

The air got heavy, and the aura rioted.

Adir glanced at the people, pointing their fingers at Narcis, and felt everything was worth it.

He channeled the mana in his body, and the ground shook. An earthen spear made of rocks rose from the soil and aimed at Narcis.

"There is nothing I don't dare. Besides, him getting first only proves you can only be second. You lose to your brother. You lose to a nobody. You'll never be first." Adir gave a condescending smile and said out loud.

"...It's true. Narcis always lost to Charles."

"Charles was always first."

"I guess some people are destined to be second."]



In a mysterious location, 8 Abyssals were seated around a table. They were the five Abyss Kings and three Abyss Queens.

They were the nightmares of humans, from Mercury to Neptune. They were the strongest Abyssals. They too surpassed the power of level 9 and were equivalent to Sovereigns.

The Kings were at least 8 feet tall and the Queens at least 7. There were three vertical marks on their forehead, which every Level 9 Abyssal had plus a star mark.

This star was their unique symbol.

The strange thing was they left were seated on either side of the table but left a single unseated chair in the middle.

The unoccupied chair was also more luxurious and higher than the one they sat on. On it was a large mirror.

The Thunder Abyssal King of Thunder Abyss, connected to Neptune, said, "Demon King, I heard Enigma stole a low altar and the cross tunneling formations from an Abyss Lord?"

The Demon Abyssal King of Demon Abyss, connected to earth, gritted his teeth and replied, "That bitch. Yes. She keeps running all around the place. How does she escape the Abyss Will?"

No one answered.

Each Abyss had an Abyss Will. None could catch Enigma. They all wanted to kill Enigma, but she hid from all the Abyss Wills.

Demon King's voice turned low "If I knew how… the Holy Altar would still be safe."

The atmosphere turned dull when "Holy Altar" was brought up. Everyone in the room had a tense expression on their face. They should protect their Abyss's Holy Altar at all costs.

Demon King clenched his fist and sighed. Just by that action, the air in his palms exploded and sent shock waves enough to kill a Level 4 Awakener.

"It's my sin." He sighed and slumped in his chair.

The Water Abyssal Queen of Water Abyss, connected to Venus, yawned and said, "So, Old Man, you are compensating for the sin?"

"Yes. Don't take my place. I'll convince His Majesty." Demon King looked at his equals and spoke with a serious face.

He was an awakener of Body path. So his physique was the strongest in the room. His brawny physique and rough done would've intimidated others, but his peers were monsters in their own right.

"Alright."

"If you say so."

Demon King was extremely grateful and was about to thank them when a light flashed from the mirror on the empty chair.

The Abyssal Kings and Queens, the power ceilings of Earth, the nightmares of humanity, stood up, bowed their heads and put their hand on their heart position for the imperial salute.

"Welcome, your Majesty."

"Sit." A magnetic voice sounded from the mirror.

An Abyssal appeared in the mirror. He was seated on a luxurious throne and wore purple clothes.

He was at least 9 feet tall and looked at them silently.

Even though he was present on the other side, millions of light years away, he exuded an aura of majesty that demanded respect and submission.

The Abyssal Kings felt veneration from the bottom of their hearts. The Abyssal Queens felt a burning fire in their eyes, but quickly suppressed it.

They weren't worthy of him. He only loved his Empress.

The strangest part was 'His Majesty' had no marks on his face.

Abyssals from Level 1-3 had marks on their chins, level 4-6 on their cheeks and 7-9, including Abyssal Kings on their foreheads to indicate their level.

But the Emperor of all Abyssals had none. He was different. Special. Unique.

He said unhurriedly, "How is the Cross Tunneling Mission taking place?"

Thunder King replied "We've occupied 5% of low level Dungeons on Neptune. 66 Level 3 Genius students were killed."

Despair Queen replied "We've…."

One by one, everyone presented their performance report.

Demon King replied the last "We've occupied 30% of low level Dungeons on Earth. 100 Level 3 Geniuses were killed."

Everyone looked at him in surprise. The pace was highest, despite Earth having a lot of dungeons.

The Abyssal Emperor, on the other side of the mirror, raised an eyebrow but made no special comments.

"Anything important to report before we proceed to the main mission?" He asked.

Thunder King nodded and said, "Your Majesty, 'He' is growing stronger every day. I'm afraid…"

"No worries. Let him gather all the six artifacts. However strong he grows, he won't be able to escape my palm." The Abyssal Emperor said curtly. His tone allowed no refusal.

"Yes, my ignorance." Thunder King bowed. He wasn't dissatisfied. Abyss Emperor's decisions were always right. He was their saviour. Their hope.

"Your majesty, we can conquer the solar system if you allow us. We now have spies and some control over humanity, unlike our first war. This time, even the Heaven's Will suppression on us won't save their lives in bunkers." Despair Queen of Despair Abyss, associated with Uranus, said.

"Please give us a chance."

"Like Pluto, we'll take down their planets one by one."

"We'll fulfill our mission."

"...please."

The other seven nodded and voiced their agreements.

"Enough. You know why Pluto is conquered." Abyss Emperor said, and the room turned silent.

"Any direct confrontation would kill millions, if not billions, of your fellow Abyssals. Will you answer their families?" Abyss Emperor glared at them as he spoke word by word.

"If humans are our only enemy, I'd still do it. It's better to pay the short-term painful price to secure victory. But humans aren't even our main enemy. We must win the battle with humans, but not at the cost of losing our war."

The rulers of the eight Abysses clenched their fists as each of his word pierced their heart.

"We don't have to wage a full scale war to destroy humans." There was a glint in Abyss Emperor's eyes.

"Let them be distracted by our movements in the Dungeons. Speed up the steps and we'll be victorious with the least bloodshed."

The Abyss rulers nodded.

Abyss Emperor glanced at Demon King and asked, "Did you find it?"

"Yes, your majesty." Demon King stood up and nodded.

"So who is willing to pay 10% of their lifespan to accomplish this mission?" Abyss Emperor asked.

"Me."

"This life is for Abyss Race. let me contribute."

"I want to contribute too."

"..."

All 8 Abyss Rulers raised their hands.

Demon King looked at them and gritted his teeth. 'You bastards. Lying so blatantly to this old man. Fine! I'll still be the one to retrieve it and atone for my sin.'

"I'll send my clone as well." Abyss Emperor disappeared, and the mirror dimmed, leaving behind only his magnetic voice.

"His majesty is so kind. He is even sending his clone."

"If not for him, we'd never have found the way to save our race."

"If not for him, we'd be like stupid villains in human novels and believe that sending dungeons to earth would be enough to kill humanity."

The praises continued, and the atmosphere was full of hope.

They were confident in their victory at the expense of human extinction.

What they didn't know was the one with the potential to stand against them was banging his head in a hospital.

"My memory is not altered? Then what about those dreams?"

Lost Dungeons were special.

Unlike normal Dungeons, the magic beasts inside these get stronger.

In the 100-year period of being 'lost' in the Inner Space, a Low Dungeon would improve to Mid Dungeon in around 20 years and take another 80 years to become a High Dungeon.

The difficulty in advancing to each level increases exponentially.

This Lost Dungeon was still transitioning from Low Dungeon to Mid Dungeon.

Once the magic beasts at the Inner Zone reach level 6, it'd be declared a Mid Dungeon.

As Varian headed forward, the aura concentration steadily rose. He thought of maximising his power before fighting the Outer boss.

For instance, he could search for more nests of magic beasts. However, that would take a lot more time. There was no guarantee he would find suitable resources either.

Besides, the Dungeon was still in its early years. That much was evident with the Outer Zone containing only Level 3 Magic Beasts.

Early years meant less natural resources.

'I can't wait that long. I want to grow strong the fastest and search for a way out.' Varian groaned inwardly.

As he gazed forward, it was a no-man's-land. There was not a single creature in sight for miles.

Not just on the ground, but even in the sky. Not a single thing flew above the land.

'The border.' He mused.

To be fair, there was no natural border between Outer and Inner Zones. That was to say, the aura concentration doesn't spike at the borders. They just increased continuously.

However, just like Old Earth, the residents of Dungeon, Magic Beasts, made up the border.

It wasn't exactly planned per se. If a weaker magic beast crossed the border, it'd be ripped to shreds in no time. Soon, no magic best crossed that land, and it turned into what it was today.

Of course, there were strong beasts that enter the Inner zone every once in a while. For them, Inner Zone was a heaven with more aura and resources.

But How to determine whether one was strong or weak?

Welcome the Bosses. These were creatures just short of entering the Inner Zone.

'Boss…'

Varian stopped in front of an arid plain. It was dry and with lush mountains surrounding it; the plain looked out of place.

'Ha!' Even though he couldn't know who it was, a sharp gaze seemed to pierce his skin.

'Boss is Boss.'

[You have advanced]

Varian heaved a sigh of relief. He battled death and prepared for what he had always dreamed of. Advancing to Level 1 and becoming an Awakener.

He hoped that becoming an Awakener could somehow save his life. But now, he could only hope it would delay his death until help found him.

[No Aura Source in Host found.]

'What?! System? There is Aura in the air. Aura in the soil. Aura in my body. Aura everywhere.' Varian almost went crazy.

[Taking Aura from Host's Body]

"Wait, no!" Varian yelled weakly as he felt the little strands of Aura in his blood, organs, bones pulled and redistributed .

The dying Abyssal was perplexed at Varian's behavior, but soon its eyes widened.

Varian felt some shackle break and the next moment, Aura in the air and soil flooded his body.

Seeping through his skin, flowing in his blood, transversing his bones and mixing with his organs, Varian felt the Aura change something fundamental in him.

Despite still being severely injured, he felt reborn.

His eyesight was sharper and he could see smaller things clearly and could view things at a larger distance. His taste, smell, touch and hearing all improved to an irreversible degree.

He took the first step on the Divine Path.

Varian didn't know how his strength and speed changed, but he could feel his body regenerating at a faster speed, and his ability to bear wounds and pain in general increased by a significant amount.

But… All that did was delay his death by a few more minutes.

'I've done my best. Killing an Abyssal as an unawakened and delaying my death by awakening… ' Varian smiled with pride and looked at the Abyssal next to him.

He wasn't dead yet. His body was trying to heal, but it was beyond its scope. Seeing the Abyssal still struggling, Varian crawled to his side with a broken leg and broken arms.

The Abyssal widened his eyes, looking at the bloodied Varian who approached him. In his eyes, Varian was akin to a bloodied Zion, their nemesis, hunting him.

Varian grinned at the dying Abyssal whose eyes fumed with rage and whispered, "Thanks to you, I was able to awaken. Also, thanks to you, I might die."

Before the Abyssal could comprehend his intention, Varian slammed his head to the Abyssal's neck, breaking it completely. Thanks to his Level 1 Body physique, he didn't break his head.

[Awakening completed] The System prompted and Varian fought hard to keep his eyes from closing.

He didn't know how long passed, but he forced himself to stay awake. His heart still had that hole and it wasn't closing anytime soon.

He tried to keep thinking, but his mind felt heavy and he felt sleepy.

'Sia… why did she ask me to save you? Are you in danger?'

'What if I really die here? If I had not given up being an awakener and entered Dungeon a year ago, none of this would've happened. So is it my own doing?'

'I hoped no one would lose a father like me, so I wanted to be the hero who would gain the title "Saviour" and end the war with Abyssals. But …'

'Sia… who are you?'

He jumped from one thought to another and finally he couldn't stay sober. As he closed his eyes, he felt like he heard something.

Varian couldn't open his eyes, no matter how hard he tried. It was as if he was trapped in the deepest corner. Sealed, never to be retrieved.

'Is this Hell?' He thought.

'Did I die before help arrived?' For a moment, Varian felt melancholic and somehow felt that he didn't live his life that well.

"Varian" a familiar voice struck him as he tremblingly turned back. He saw her.

Blue hair like the sky, and red eyes that shone with kindness. Amanda stood in front of him and stretched her hands. "Give mom a hug."

Varian lost himself, and before he knew it, his cheeks were wet. Through his wet eyes, he looked at her and stepped forward. But ...

"I'm grown up now, mom. No hugs." a young voice sounded, startling Varian.

As he turned to the side, Varian's eyes widened. He saw a younger version of himself, the 11-year-old Varian.



Chapter 25: Immortal Species (Two)

Red. The color of blood.

He shook his head feeling dizzy.

‘Where am I?’

Sharp pain assaulted his chest and abdomen.

He groaned in bewilderment. He opened his eyes in a daze only to see bloodiness in front of him.

At this moment, a familiar and gentle voice said, “Qiren. Do not move! Hold on a little more! The ambulance is coming.”

He was calm for a moment but at the next moment, the pain in his chest and the dizziness in his head became more intense.

“Wu Qiren!” The voice became more and more alarmed. “You cannot die here! You… Right. You still have not changed the world! How could you die here? You still have not changed the world. What qualification do you have to have a baby with me then?”

‘Change the world? Have a baby?’

His sobered up a little and breathed heavily. He felt much better.

In a bloodied state he endured the acute pain and put on a forced smile.

“Is the Second Year Syndrome treatable…ahh1”

The familiar voice was seemingly crying tears of joy. However, the weeping laughter seemed to get softer and weaker like a candle about to die out.

He suddenly panicked.

‘No. It will not happen.’

He smiled painfully and wanted to call out to that voice. He wanted to joke around with her as usual. However, when he opened his mouth, he found that he could not call out her name.

It was still red and bloody in front of him but his whole body felt hotter.

*Poof*

Thales fell into a thicket of grass. He opened his eyes and became fully aware.

“Damn it! What happened?” By Thales’ side was the pale-skinned blond-haired man cursing angrily.

“How did it use up so much blood?” His voice was filled with suspicion and dissatisfaction.

Thales realized that the blond-haired man turned into watery blood and took him flying at high speeds. Thales had another flashback. In that fragment of dreamland, it seemed he ‘lost control’ again,

‘This time the displacement is effected by the blond-haired man through watery blood?’

Thales felt as though he had just got off a roller coaster, crashing on the ground and coughing dryly.

‘Fortunately, I have experienced carsickness… Er, ‘man-sickness with Yodel before this.’

Thales thought to himself as he shook his head, trying to get rid of the disturbing red blood color from his mind.

“It is obviously almost time to go. Could it be that the injury has not yet healed? The Blood Image Dance is no longer proficient…” The handsome blonde murmured and rudely grabbed Thales.

‘It looks as though it is already dusk. Has the sun set behind the hill? It is also a bit cold. Are we outdoors?’

Thales could clearly see that they had fallen on a dusky trail by a thicket of grass. In front of him was an expansive manor with a large garden.

A flag flapped at the iron gate located between the garden and the dusky trail. Weeds grew thick at the manor as though its owner never took care of it.

If not for the fact that it was less refined, it could have been comparable to Mindis Hall.

‘That flag.’ Thales narrowed his eyes and saw three strange petals. It was red, blue and green in color.

Thales recognized the flower. It was the favorite flower of Wu Qiren’s first girlfriend.

‘Is this an Iris? Is this a noble’s coat of arms? This is probably one of the ‘enemies’ that Gilbert mentioned. What terrible luck. I fell right into an enemy’s nest.’

“Go quickly! Little whelp of the mortal species!” The blonde impatiently pushed him towards the manor.

Thales’ thoughts furiously churned and reasoned.

‘Looks like this handsome young man knows how to speak and is not just a brute that is difficult to tame. On top of that, he had also left behind other words such as how this was just an exercise and how it was fortunate that the sun was about to set.’

Thales thought it was fortunate that the guy seemed rational and then tried to find a countermeasure. The JC dagger was at his waist but it was evident he could not hope to ‘put this dagger to the man’s neck’ or anything like that. He also could not suddenly injure himself to inform Gilbert and Yodel as it was too meticulous and obvious.

He could only gather intelligence first.

“Hey!” Thales turned around and shook off the blonde’s hand. “I see you have the demeanor and temperament of a noble. Your actions must match your appearance. Pay attention to your manners!”

The blond-haired man was stopped by this remark.

“Manners? Demeanor?” The man grinned and deliberately revealed his two ferocious fangs. “I need to show manners to food fated to be eaten?”

The man purposely ground his sharp fangs.

‘It is really similar to that creature from my memories.’

Thales leaned ahead and glanced at the two fangs. He contemptuously curled his lips and said, “Your attitude towards food is terrible. You do not have the talent of a gourmet. The mental and physical conditions of the food could affect its quality. What are you going to do if your rudeness affects its taste?”

The handsome blonde was stunned for about three seconds and his malevolent expression had half relaxed. He then replied, “Nonsense. Little whelp, you certainly have guts.” The man then laughed and added, “However, you are not the first food that was courageous. No need to try your luck. You cannot escape.”

“So that my flesh and blood would become tastier?” Thales showed an expression as if he finally understood. He then unexpectedly walked towards the manor.

The man had gotten ready to carry him to the manor ahead when the man saw him walk to the front by himself.

The blond-haired man stretched his hand to scratch his head, puzzled at the food (he felt disdain in calling them ‘prey’) that did not seem to have any intention to escape. Half-way through the man felt that this was inappropriate and could only put down his hand. He then quickly kept up with Thales with a speed visible to humans.

“Not your flesh and blood. Just your blood. I believe you should have been injured recently? The smell of blood is drifting everywhere. Tsk. It is so fragrant I feel like having a mouthful first.”

The two continued to move forward.

“Then how do you prepare to eat me? Do you nibble or just suck the blood? From where do you start? Do you use seasonings?’

“The Tuvalus like to eat their meat raw. They enjoy the howling of their prey. We generally suck the blood directly and it is divided into neck food and wrist food. As for seasonings… Wait. Why am I talking about these to a short-lived whelp like you?

The blonde stopped and looked at Thales who evidently did not behave like a seven-year-old.

“I am destined to be food right? Shouldn’t it be a virtue to be polite to food that willingly gets sacrificed? Isn’t that a virtue? Food that was in a good mental state may even taste better.”

“You… are weird as food. Do you think your actions would make me release you?”

“It is hard to come by good food. Of course, it must be rare. Come. There is no need to stop. Let us continue walking. What is your name sir?”

“Young whelp? Why do you ask? Do you want revenge?” The blonde stopped again. His suspicion and vigilance of the boy increasing.

“With your skill, it would not be easy to take revenge on you. Since I am already about to be eaten by you, you should at least tell me your name, right? Besides that, isn’t shouting hey inconsiderately too boorish? Mm…You are not an illegitimate child without a surname right? You should at least have a name.”

The blonde seemingly felt his pride stabbed by the last few words. He then proudly replied, “My name is Istrone van Leica Liszt Corleone from the Night Kingdom. The Leader of Seven Pillars, the Corleone Family’s first-class Blood Knight.”

“Come. Come. Let us keep moving. So why do you call me a mortal?”

“What else could humans who have lifespans of less than one hundred and twenty years old be other than mortals? Even young whelps like you would live another ninety years at most.” Istrone showed disdain.

“So you guys are ‘immortals’ that have longer lifespans compared to us?”

“Of course. A vampire’s lifespan is endless, more than what the inferior mortals could imagine.”

Thales quietly filed away the information in his mind.

‘Istrone Corleone. Mortals. Immortals. Night Kingdom. Corleone Family. The superior vampires. The most important point was that he did not seem interested as to why I appeared at Mindis Hall. This may be my only way out… Oh. I had forgotten that he wanted to ‘eat’ me’.

Thales and Istrone walked into the manor. The transmigrator’s eyes narrowed. At the entrance, two fierce-looking men wearing red scarves headed towards them.

‘The Blood Bottle Gang? Why are they here?’

“Tell me. Why did you we stop here? Is it better to simply fly in?”

“If it was not because of the Blood Image Dance… Sigh…”

The handsome Istrone suddenly realized that the mortal whelp could understand his words. So, he gracefully cleared his throat and indifferently continued.

“Hmph. I would have flown in if this was my territory. However, we are only guests and need to maintain respect and courtesy towards the host.”

‘An immortal that pays attention to elegance.’ Thales thought to himself.

The two helpers from the Blood Bottle Gang walked up. They looked at the two with bad expressions and said, “Who is it?”

However, Istrone furrowed his eyebrows. With a cool expression, he interrupted them with disdain.

“Get lost! Inferior mortals!”

Thales’ expression twitched as he took back his earlier words.

…

A few minutes ago,

After the fiasco from the ‘One Night War’, one of the few Blood Bottle Gang members who were in power rushed back to the capital. One full day after the battle the head of the Psionic Warriors, ‘Red Viper’ Nikolay, still looked hard pressed.

In the very least, together with the other three Psionic Warriors, he had to preserve the current status before the Blood Mystic, who had stayed hidden for a very long time, rushed back.

First, he had to deal with the aftermath of the One Night War. Other than the explosion, there was also the issue of the Air Mystic disappearing without any trace. His personal bodyguard, that lunatic with the sword, was lying there with Ralf. Their upper bodies were almost cut open. One could only guess that Asda had also been killed. So, Nikolay had to make certain that the Brotherhood’s three Assassins, especially the Black Sword himself, was in the capital before he could leave in peace. (In fact, Tinker, who had just come back from the Red Street Market, thought that he was oversensitive. Even if the Black Sword was at the capital, the man would not bother looking at him.)

Tinker and Noumea were amongst the few Twelve Strongest of the Blood Bottle Gang to return. (“Shit. So it was the cowards who would live to the end.”- Nikolay) They would not say what happened at the Red Street Market except that there was fear and panic. Nikolay had given up looking for the truth. As for revenge for the Air Mystic, he would discuss this with the Blood Mystic once that person returns.

The Blood Bottle Gang’s morale took a huge blow after losing the highly profitable Red Street Market that they had occupied for a long time. Most of the common helpers had begun to waver. Their customers, regardless of whether they were nobles, merchants or people from the same trade, expressed deep unswerving friendship to the Blood Bottle Gang, but at the same time reduced all their dealings and withdraw their funds. Some even broke their contracts. (Shit! Calm down. Stay calm. The debt of blood must be repaid! – Nikolay)

The Blood Bottle Gang members whose morale had fallen at the other districts in the capital retreated when confronted with the irresistible ‘inferior’ Brotherhood. It could be imagined that when the news spread nationwide, the fight at every branch would likely end up the same way.

Second, the major supporter behind the Blood Bottle Gang, the Covendier Family with the crest of the Tricolor Iris was indifferent even after finding out about their crushing defeat. He did not appease them nor did he reinforce them. He also did not even spend a single copper to comfort them.

What Nikolay resented the most was that they had previously done a lot of dirty work for them all over the kingdom. At this crucial moment, Seychelles, the Knight of Termination did not even let him in through the front gate of the Duke’s manor. That afternoon, he was even ordered to ‘thoroughly investigate the theft at Mindis Hall’.

‘Theft? Shit. Which part of me looks like a police investigator? Can I cut that part off?’

Thinking of police officers, Nikolay became even more furious. ‘Damn. That cop of the West District. That Lorbec or Lockerbie is usually smiling. I am not sure if he has dispatched people at the crucial moments of the One Night War to reinforce, did we not agree to have police-community cooperation? Forget it.’ Nikolay suppressed his unhappiness.

‘Lorbec had used all sorts of excuses when he wanted a few corpses. The funny part was that he acted like a righteous envoy. After receiving so many inducements you act like a righteous envoy? What are you doing talking about righteousness in front of me, Nikolay? Which part of me looks like a good person? Can I cut that part off? Damn. In the old times, I would have gone to his house, strip his wife naked and hang her at the doorbell of the Western City Gate.’

Besides that, Nikolay wanted to settle a matter involving Covendier’s three vampires. The vampires were unexpectedly sent to the Blood Bottle Gang’s branch in the Eastern City District. (The Vine Manor was actually also Covendier’s property.) ‘Take good care of them? Did you think we are entertaining lost puppies? They want the blood of ten people every day! They even asked for supra class masters! Good. Now we might as well find the Black Sword, knock him out and then tie him up before giving him to them! I already sent them all the Blood Bottle Gang members that I disliked and it is still insufficient! I even had to softly persuade that cop for corpses! Which part of me looks like an animal breeder? Can I cut that part off? The most annoying part was that the number of vampires were not many, but were short-tempered and bossy. They looked at me as though I am a dog!’

Thus, with a bad mood, Nikolay took his entourage to the Vine Manor in the night. He lightly waved his hand as a greeting to the other Blood Bottle Gang members whose expressions were equally bad.

When he walked into the main building of the manor, to the stone staircase, he heard faint sobbings and wretched cries from below. This made Nikolay who was already in a terrible mood even more distraught.

He resisted the urge to think about the ‘blood food’ in the dungeon (many of whom were his former colleagues and subordinates). His face was ashen as he went up to the second floor. He pushed open the wooden door of the main hall and looked displeased at the few people in front of him. To be precise, there were two people and their food in front of him.

One was pretty, fair-skinned, had a red ponytail, sexy and was attractive. The woman that looked like she was about thirty years of age wore a noble’s horse riding clothes. She gently pushed away a man whose eyes were in a daze.

The seductive woman licked the bloodstain on her lips. She gave a captivating smile to Nikolay and extended her finger to wipe away the blood at her chin.

The man that was pushed away seemed like a plundered civilian. He looked absent-minded and his skin was deathly pale. He fell to the ground and twitched. His breathing became weaker and weaker as he soon perished.

There were at least seven to eight of these that had died from excessive blood loss in the hall. The corpses were dried up with bloodstains everywhere.

Fresh blood dripped slowly onto the ground and the table, the sound utterly terrifying.

At the full-wall window in the hall was a similarly luxuriously dressed old man with white hair. He stood with both his hands on his back and seemed to be waiting for the moon to rise.

“Oops.” A gentle voice came out from the woman’s mouth. Her eyes lit up. “Have you sent us something nice to eat? Are there twenty people? Was there any supra class? Any virgins? Any young children?”

‘These damn vampires! Did they go out hunting for living people again?’

“Miss Rolana! Mister Chris! I just wanted to tell you something.” Nikolay suppressed the unhappiness and disgust as he said unhappily to the two vampires, “The twenty corpses sent here in the afternoon is the limit. Our blood bank reserves are not that high.”

When Nikolay said the words ‘blood bank’, he remembered the anguished cries in the prison cell and felt nauseated.

“Oh?” The attractive Rolana laughed. Her lips curled upwards and her eyes gradually showed a dangerous gaze. “Can the blood of those dead people be eaten? What we want is the blood of the living.”

“Otherwise, if and when I see you Blood Bottle Gang members come and go, I might not be able to resist…” Rolana revealed her sharp fangs and adopted a charming posture. She placed her forefinger on her sharp fang. With the light from the Everlasting Lamp along with the bloody backdrop, Rolana had a strange malevolent beauty.

“Three distinguished guests. Please understand. The Eternal Star City is the capital. Our capabilities are limited…” Nikolay suppressed his anger and quietly replied.

“Aiya. But didn’t that young and cute Iris Duke said that he could give as many people and as much blood as we wanted? If he found out how his loyal dog is entertaining the guests, he may not give you bones to eat. Haha.”

‘Loyal dog? Bones? Fuck!’

As he listened to the peculiar humiliation and mocking words from the arrogant vampire and then thought of the Iris Duke’s attitude after the defeat at the Red Street Market, also all the irritation he went through the entire day, Nikolay felt a huge fire burn in his heart.

“Fucking bitch! There are no living people!”

Nikolay roared as he ruthlessly slammed the table with his palm, disregarding all the bloodstains on it.

“Do not think I do not know that you vampires only need the blood of the dead to keep living! You do not need the blood of the living at all! This is no longer like hundreds of years ago!”

“I worked so hard to bring all these living and dead here. There was even one supra class and you complain that it is still not fucking enough?”

“If you want to eat, eat! Otherwise, get lost! I am not easily frightened! Worst comes to worst, we will just part ways! We will just pull back our troops and fight!”

“We are from Blood Bottle Gang of Constellation, we repay blood debts! We are not like Covendier who dies for his friends!”

There was a moment of silence, except for the heavy breathing of the Red Viper in the hall. Even Nikolay’s entourage retreated back a little from fear.

After that, Rolana’s expression changed. She extended her fangs and her expression turned malevolent. Her originally alluring voice like a spoiled child became sharp and wild.

“Inferior mortals! I will be polite and give your master some face! Blood of corpses? You yourself could live on water, vegetables and rotting flesh. Why do you need to drink wine and eat meat? You worked hard? That half dead supra class was just used by you to avenge private wrongs. You just want us to help you settle your internal affairs. You want to talk about repaying blood debts to the Corleone Family? I can have you experience your paying of ‘blood debts’ right now!”

The anger in Nikolay’s eyes became more intense. He gritted his teeth and pulled open his scarlet jacket. The sinister Rolana gave a delicate cry and jumped onto to the top of the chandelier. She brandished her fangs and claws like a cat.

Just at the moment both sides had their daggers drawn, the old man at the window turned around.

“Rolana. Be mindful of your manners.”

“Mister Nikolay. There is no need for this. If we fall out, the one embarrassed would be Duke Zayen.”

His voice was not loud but clearly resounded in the ears of everyone in the hall.

Chris Corleone, the white-haired old man suddenly appeared in front of Nikolay.

Before the boss of the Blood Bottle Gang could react, Chris stretched out his hand and patted the Red Viper’s shoulder.

The old man’s act restrained Red Viper’s anger.

Rolana descended back to the ground and returned to her captivating appearance. She laughed but her eyes still looked fierce.

“Apologies. They are still young and cannot control their temper.” Chris gave a cryptic glance. His wrinkled face was dark and silent.

‘Young?’ Nikolay cursed in his heart. ‘You have the nerve to call a monster that is several hundred years old, young?’

However, Nikolay still suppressed the anger in his heart. The circumstances do not favor him.

‘This old monster looked sickly but the skill he showed with his hand just now… With my own capabilities, I would not be able to deal with him.’

“How about this? The past few days have been exhausting for you. From now on we will deal with the matters of food by ourselves.”

Chris’ eyes remained fixed like his lifeless tone.

‘You will solve it yourself? Based on the characteristics of the vampires, hunting for prey outside would eventually turn into a disaster! But doesn’t that concur with my wishes?’

“Let’s go!” Nikolay waved indignantly. “Take all our brothers away.”

“Oh? Are you not even leaving one behind? There are people who still want to apologize here…” Rolana alluringly lay down on the bloody table and returned to her coquettish self.

“There is no need!” Nikolay turned his head back and replied. “It is best to avoid making Miss Rolana unable to resist.”

The thugs of the Blood Bottle Gang followed behind Nikolay and went downstairs. No one felt regret leaving the nauseating manor.

After a while, only the sound of Rolana’s weird laughter and the dripping of blood remained in the hall.

Nikolay soon went far away.

Rolana suddenly got down from the table. Her face was cold and stern.

“Did he notice something?”

Chris shook his death-like head. He looked like a white chess piece from afar. “This guy did not but Covendier had certainly noticed something strange. After all, so much blood is enough to feed a squad of Blood Knights.”

Rolana lowered her head. “However, this is still not enough. I just wasted another one just to put on an act. I will go hunting again.”

“Fortunately, we have chased away the Blood Bottle Gang as planned. This will give us some time before we get exposed.”

Chris suddenly turned his head back about a hundred degrees and looked out the window. His nose twitched a little.

“Istrone has returned. He also brought back… this fragrance… It is high-class blood.”

His figure reappeared at the window. The moon came out.

…

Nikolay took the Blood Bottle Gang group and angrily stepped out of the manor.

‘These damn vampires… hm? That white-faced vampire has returned. Didn’t he follow those mercenaries to Mindis Hall to find treasure in the afternoon? So, he also knows how to use his legs to walk, using the main gate?’

Nikolay had thought that when the vampire was in a hurry, like what he had once seen, he would transform into watery blood and flow around.

‘That white-faced vampire even brought back a boy? Damn. He also went out hunting for food? Looking at the way he is dressed, he must be from a noble family. However, he is covered in injuries… That is not right. That child does not look like he is being held hostage. Their footsteps look as though they are walking as a group.’

‘That’s right. I need to ask about the theft at Mindis Hall.’

While Nikolay was thinking, Istrone and Thales entered the manor.

From afar, Thales already saw the Blood Bottle Gang that was walking out.

When he thought of the flag with the Iris flower, he gloomily cried out in his heart. He knew that the had to remain calm so that he could find a way to survive the dangers ahead.

Istrone gazed fixedly ahead as though he did not pay attention to those from the Blood Bottle Gang.

Nikolay waved his hand and the Blood Bottle Gang stopped and waited for Istrone to come over.

However, the handsome blond-haired vampire simply snorted through his nose. His head looked towards the side as he impolitely walked past the Red Viper. It was as though he had no words to say.

However, the vampire immediately noticed that the human that was not even as tall as his waist strode forward with his head held high. The kid huffed and synchronized his pace as he walked past Nikolay with his nose held high.

‘What kind of situation is this? Is he using his master to bully others?’

Istrone resolved himself to punish the child that loved to play dumb.

Only Thales knew that he himself was pretending to be calm by strongly suppressing the beating of his heart.

Nikolay’s anger rose again.

“Hey! Pretty boy!” The Red Viper blocked Istrone’s path. “Have you completed the task His Excellency the Duke has asked you to do?” Nikolay asked in a bad mood as he looked at the handsome vampire.

‘His Excellency the Duke?’ Thales secretly questioned.

Istrone looked up at the human who stopped him with disgust.

“The stolen treasure at Mindis Hall! Did you remember? You even took four groups of mercenaries with you!” Istrone’s gaze towards him made Nikolay full of anger. Nikolay walked up to the vampire’s nose and loudly shouted, “Pretty boy. Shouldn’t you have obtained something?”

‘Pretty boy?’

‘Repulsive mortals!’ Anger welled up in Istrone’s heart. He originally wanted to deceive the mercenaries by sending them out and then hunt them one by one, treating them as an excellent source of blood to bring back to the manor.

He never expected the weird masked man to finish them off at Mindis Hall.

‘As for the theft at the Mindis Hall, this was something requested by the Duke of the Iris Flower.’

‘I still need to say something.’

Istrone turned to look at Thales. Nobody knew his state of mind that had already turned ice cold.

‘What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?’

‘Calm down!’ The boy told himself. ‘I must save myself!’

His brain spun wildly as each report and element flashed through his mind and regrouped.

Istrone lowered his head and looked at the boy. He wondered what to say to Nikolay so as to not lose face in front of the mortals.

Nikolay looked at the arrogant Istrone. He followed Istrone’s gaze and then turned to the little boy beside him.

“Hey, kid…” Istrone said without paying attention.

Everyone looked at Thales. At this moment, Thales took a deep breath.

‘According to the Second Year Syndrome, I am the man that is to change the world. How can I die here?’

After that, the others saw the seven-year-old boy’s expression turn cold. He shouted before Istrone could say his next words.

“Yes. Your Excellency!”

Istrone froze for a moment. ‘This brat. Why is he suddenly so respectful?’

However, before he could react, the situation changed.

Thales stepped forward without hesitation. He was like a loyal guard standing in between Istrone and Nikolay.

And then, under the bright moonlight…

Everyone heard the voice of the young boy with an annoying expression looking at the man currently in charge of the Blood Bottle Gang, the head of the Psionic Warriors, Red Viper Nikolay. The childish voice had an arrogant tone as he shouted,

“Get lost! Mortals! His Excellency, the noble Istrone Corleone does not need a lowly and talkative dog meddling in his affairs!”




“Pardon my coming here presumptuously. But if the news from the Sunset Temple… If the information is reliable…” The right hand of the grey-haired middle-aged noble trembled slightly. He held his left chest and bowed deeply.

“Please allow me to personally settle this matter for you.”

“You are quite well informed, old friend.”

“It is not yet confirmed but that Lamp in the Sunset Temple has lit. Looks like it is quite close by.”

Beside the blazing fire, a robust figure lowered his right hand near his chin and somberly said, “I have already dispatched Yodel. He is better than Aida at being inconspicuous”

“You know how important this information is. Even Liscia immediately sealed off the altar in the name of the oracle. That is why I cannot risk unnecessary exposure. I would only dispatch you in secret after there is absolute confirmation.”

“Of course, of course.” The gray-haired middle-aged noble concealed his excitement with difficulty. “If that time comes, I will wholeheartedly serve you.”

The robust figure sighed. “I should be more excited than you when I heard this news.

“But I don’t know why. I am feeling very calm.”

…

Rick did not know how he ended up returning to the headquarters of the Brotherhood.

The cold feeling at his neck was still there.

When he saw the Black Street headquarters, the two elite guards were playing knife games at the entrance. When he reached just outside the building, some shadowy figures were on guard, keeping watch. He entered the building and saw Powerhouse Morris behind the large iron table, examining the account books, and Felicia who had a disgusted expression (her proposal to raise the expenses of the brothel was rejected). He finally felt relieved. Even the Assassin Layork who had always been on bad terms with him seemed amiable sitting at the dining table in the candlelight.

Without noticing, the cold feeling at his neck disappeared as though it was never there.

Even Rick wondered if he had been too nervous.

He talked to Morris who was in charge of human trafficking that he suspected someone had been following him. Layork laughed and spat out a mouthful of wine. It extinguished the flames from the candle on the table. Felicia gave a huge yawn and tightened her large bosom. The look in her eyes became even more despicable.

Morris noticed Rick’s cold sweat and weird look. He then patted Rick’s shoulder. He told Rick not to overwork and watch less of Dark Night Temple’s dramas. Rick was also told to wait for Doctor Ramon to give him some calming prescriptions when he returned from his call.

‘Shit!’

Rick knew it was difficult for others to believe in his special ability, let alone an Assassin who had followed him from the Abandoned Houses to Black Street. This person had followed him for an entire kilometer and remained unseen as well as not taking any action. However, Rick subconsciously believed that this person was real.

After he returned to his room and lay down, he recalled the events in the tailing encounter that night. Even though he was usually very paranoid he could not help but think to himself: ‘Was I really too nervous?’

Rick calmed down again and tried to use his ability again. Everything was fine. The back of his neck felt comfortable.

‘Alright. I was probably paranoid.’

But suddenly, the hair-raising chill in the neck struck again!

‘F*ck!’

‘I can’t sleep anymore!’

Rick suddenly jumped out of bed.

He pulled out a box from under the bed. Inside the box was a Siegel 6 Mystic Gun that needed to be carried with both hands. Feeling nervous, he stuck to the walls and carefully walked out to the hallway and listened carefully.

The hallway was full of lamps using Eternal Oil that would never extinguish. The hallway was very brightly lit but there was still nobody around. At a distance, a sentry on duty just came out of the toilet and was walking back. As though scratching at an itch, he pulled the crotch of his leather armor as he walked past Rick.

At the end of the hallways, Layork and Felicia shouted their licentious cries as usual.

“Damn. May this shameless couple break his penis after using too much force.” Rick cursed loudly.

The Brotherhood member from earlier had the same feeling. He turned around and nodded to Rick. Their eyes locked as a sense of understanding appeared between the two.

Rick then saw the member scratch the crotch of his armor painfully. Meanwhile, the other party looked at him trying very hard to carry the Mystic Gun and leaning against the wall.

Both of them turned around awkwardly and went back to their original locations.

Rick rubbed the back of his neck.

‘Shit. This ability must not be working properly.’

If a skilled elite of the enemy could sneak into the Brotherhood HQ undetected, holding the Mystic Gun would be pointless. Powerhouse Morris’ ability would also be useless.

‘Time to sleep!’

…

Thales’ back injuries looked bad but it was not serious. This was because he was able to stand and walk again by the third day.

Yes, a famous person’s attributes would be heavenly gifted. While lining up, Thales sighed as he looked at the Abandoned Houses with broken walls. He then received the rye bread and wild herbs from the thug Pierson and started to eat it.

He had unfortunately been born in such a place.

“By your side is a sharp branch. You must be the one who cut my hand!”

“It is not me! My hand was also hurt last night!”

“All of us had our hands hurt! It must be the people from the eighth house! They envy our gains from yesterday.”

“So, it was them! We from the fourteenth house were also injured at night! They do not want us to go out and pickpocket!”

Thales yawned as he lazily listened to the beggars from the other houses. The argument developed into a fight. Beside these beggars was a crowd cheering. This happened until the thugs stopped them. Thales sighed as he swallowed the last mouthful of the awful food, then clapped his hands as he called out to the beggars from the sixth house.

“Time to work.”

That day was Tuesday. The sixth house’s begging went smoothly. For more business, they went near the sentry post, which was located at Western City Gate.

The recent week seemed to be the celebration of the Sunset God. However, there was a rumor that there was an oracle command to seal off the altar. This led to many believers entering the city from the west that week. They climbed the city walls and prayed to the setting sun as atonement for not being able to pray to the Sunset Goddess’ local representative.

Before the guards’ angry glares graduated to physical obstacles, Thales had successfully stolen a Luminous Moon deity statue made of black wood from a street vendor with the help of Coria and Ryan. The street vendor had paid too much attention to his wallet (“Go away bastards!”). So, when Ryan and Coria were busy haggling with him for some stuff, Thales stretched out his hand and took the package behind him.

The market price of the Luminous Moon deity statue was at least fifty coppers. Naturally, the statue should not see the light of day and could only be sold through the Brotherhood channel. The veterans in the Brotherhood would know that they were just beggars and thieves. They would then push down the buying price, and if it were anything valuable they would even fight over it. Earning five coppers from it was already good.

However, the smallest mosquitos were still food even though tiny.

When Thales and the others returned to the Abandoned Houses, they saw Rick patrol the place. But he was not the usual calm and amiable self. Instead, he hurriedly admonished the guards with a few words and then disappeared.

“Is Mister Rick in trouble?” The hungry Coria bit her fingers, her stomach rumbling away. They had gone far and returned home late. Fortunately, Thales had quite a good relationship with the thug distributing the meals, Pierson. He often bribed him a little and then the other side would agree to keep some rice for them.

“It is probably Quide. That guy really knows how to create problems.” Kellet replied. His stomach also cried out.

Hearing this name, Ryan and Ned trembled.

“Kids. There is no more food tonight.” When the six entered, they could not see a soul in the dining yard. In the distance, Pierson who was in charge of getting food for them, waved his hand.

“Don’t look at me. I also can’t do anything about it.” Pierson shook his head when faced with six angry children with no energy to ask questions and ignored them. “Rick had ordered us to rest earlier and moved our schedules ahead.”

Thales frowned and touched his empty belly. He started thinking about whether to sneak into the thug’s sentry posts and steal some food at night.

He then looked at the other five anxiously waiting for food and sighed. He took out the Luminous Moon statue from his pocket.

Finally, with Thales’ persuasion, the Luminous Moon statue was used to trade with Pierson for the food he had initially prepared for himself: two strips of dog meat, four halves of rye bread and half a bowl of black pine vegetable.

“Recently, Rick and Quide are rather edgy.” While the other children ate, Pierson told Thales a piece of information before he left. “Quide’s temper is getting worse by the day. He kept cursing some ‘damn baldy’ all day but he had always been like that. However, Rick has become weird especially in the last two days. According to those in the headquarters…”

At this moment, Pierson looked around and then whispered to Thales. “…he got tangled up with a ghost.”

Thales watched Pierson leave as he bit into the unpalatable rye bread. However, when one is hungry, the rye bread would be particularly delicious.

Thales silently pondered. ‘I wonder what happened to Rick to end up running into a ghost.’

‘As for what made Quide in a bad mood…’ Thales swallowed the bread. ‘Looks like I need to keep a low profile for now.’

…

Rick became nervous again. Two days ago, he had thought that his special ability made a mistake.

That was until this morning when he opened up the register to prepare for the beggar’s supplies. At that time, he had confirmed that his special ability did not make a mistake.

Rick was an ambitious person. He had believed that to achieve his ambition, he needed to start working on the small details, like the daily habits One example was that he would never write his plans and travel itinerary on paper. Another example was that hairs would be placed at inconspicuous places at all the drawers and containers keeping the important documents in case someone sneaked a look at them. He also did not keep all of his money in one place. He was proud of his own cautiousness and believed that he would be rewarded one day for it.

Like now.

When Rick opened the roster of beggars, there was a hair on each page in the same position.

This should have been a good thing. It would mean that nobody had flipped the pages. However, Rick was the son of a scribe.

His father had taught him that if a person wants it done, it was possible for a good thief or ranger to avoid the hair trick. They can open up the documents they want with the utmost secrecy.

And so, Rick learned a more cautious approach from his father.

The way to read the pages in secret would obviously be to put the hair strands back in their original position after flipping the pages.

The fastest way would be to hold the hair in place, turn the pages, then use the hand to hold the top and bottom layer of the page to keep the hair in place.

How would one counter this method?

For nobles, the fastest and safest would be to use a wax seal.

However, Rick’s father had a special method. They used fry oil1 to create a sticky gel. This oil was used by the poor living near the river bank. One characteristic and also the weakness of this gel was that it was not very sticky. As long as the book was not too heavy, even if the book is closed after being coated, the glued area would not stick. An external force was needed to hold both sides for some time before the page would stick.

When Rick opened the roster, he found the hair at the same place except for something different. The hair was stuck to the page.

Someone had been reading his list of beggars. That person held this hair as that person flipped the pages.

Rick felt his heart turn cold.

‘On top of that, to have all four hairs at inconspicuous positions at their original positions without leaving any traces show that this person is a master.’

‘Fortunately, this secret technique that was passed down by my father enabled me to notice this.’

‘Four days ago, after watching Thales’ begging act, I looked through the roster to find out which house he lived in. At that time, everything was normal.’

‘From then until now. In these four days, somebody had come into my room and looked at the roster of beggars?’

Rick’s scalp felt cold. He suddenly realized that this was not the most important thing.

He frantically opened the secret compartment of the drawers and checked the most important document, the trafficking books and the passbook of his secret deposits at Princely Bank.

His books and passbook were all safe. There were no signs of them being flipped and the hairs also fell naturally.

Rick felt relieved.

‘Fortunately, the things in the secret compartment are still… wait. If it was a master. How did he miss the secret compartment?’

He took out the entire secret compartment and took it apart. He then placed his hand on the top of one part of the secret compartment to look for the hair that was stuck there.

After that, he collapsed back in his chair.

The hair was still stuck to a seam of the secret compartment.

When Rick was still scared out of his wits, he entered the dining hall. He turned a blind eye to the flirting Layork and Felicia. However, the always objectionable Layork loved gloating over other’s misfortune. He shouted out to Rick.

“Accountant. I heard you met a ghost?”

Rick ignored him and sat down but continued to look expressionless. He pulled over a bottle of ink used for bookkeeping and treated it as sauce as he poured it over his beefsteak.

“Don’t mind him.” Felicia smiled as she sat in Layork’s arms. She glanced amorously at the Assassin with her lips pursed and fed red wine to him. “Do you still want to come to my room tonight?”

“Of course. Of course,” Layork hurriedly replied without waiting to swallow the wine, “I just learned today that the boss had removed the sentries outside the rooms a week ago. So, tonight we can… hahaha… we can be even wilder.”

“Aiyo. You are really naughty.”

*Clang*

Rick’s ink bottle fell and spilled ink onto the table. The ink flowed to the front of the couple.

He had a pale expression as he raised his head to see the displeased Layork and Felicia.

“A week ago, there were no sentries at the houses at the headquarters?”

“Nonsense!” Layork wiped away the ink smeared on his body. In a bad mood, he threw a bread at Rick’s face. “Recently, there is a lot of activity at the Blood Bottle Gang. The boss said he wants to keep this confidential and the fewer people around the better. That is why the sentry posts were moved outside the house. They are not even allowed to go into the house to use the toilet. However, you do not have to worry. Don’t you have an inseparable ghost protecting you?”

“Then, in that hallway…” Rick did not realize that his voice started to tremble. “There should be no sentries at that passageway?”

Layork and Felicia had already started kissing each other as though there was nobody else around.

Rick took a deep breath.

‘The day before yesterday, I was followed for some unknown reason at the Abandoned Houses. Then that night there was a non-existent sentry in the walkway. Lastly, someone looked at the beggar’s roster in the room.’

‘Wonderful. Everything is starting to connect.’

Nayer Rick then nervously told himself.

‘You are being watched.’

‘Your opponent could be very powerful. Powerful enough to move freely in the heavily guarded headquarters in Black Street. Not even a terrible Assassin like Layork or an experienced warrior like the boss, Morris, noticed’.

‘I was lucky to receive my late father’s blessings and noticed this.’

‘He could be right behind me!’

‘I must save myself!’

‘I need to find his motive! ‘

Rick’s mind ran wildly.

‘In the past two days, that guy must have already turned my room upside down. However, he had only had a good look at the beggar’s roster. My more important account book was discarded as though it was a worn-out shoe. ‘

‘That guy is looking for something in the beggar’s roster. That’s right. When I was being followed, I was at the Abandoned Houses. Those were the beggar’s residences!

‘He is looking for a beggar!’

However, Rick had a headache thinking. He had more than a hundred beggars under him. The next month, Behrs would send another group of children of unknown origins. (The important and valuable children such as the descendants of some of the elites or children of the wealthy were either already ransomed or killed.) Which beggar was the guy looking for?

‘With such terrifying skill and strength, why did he not just demand openly from the Brotherhood? We would just give him to you!’

‘I would rather be in a harmonious relationship with him. I might as well drag out all the beggars and strip them naked to do a body search. Or maybe I would kill them all. This would be better than being scared out of his wits having a ‘ghost’ hanging around.’

‘Wait. I just noticed something.’

‘Why did he not make a request to the Brotherhood?’

‘Naturally, this is because it is something nobody should know, even if it was the Black Street Brotherhood.’

‘Are they the Brotherhood’s competitors? That is wrong. If the Blood Bottle Gang had such strength, the Black Street Brotherhood would have already been destroyed dozens of times.’

‘That means he does not have any formal channel and also felt that dealing with the Brotherhood of the Lower City District was not worth the time.’

‘Naturally, such terrifying people would not have any dealing with gangs from the slums.’

‘Why is he interested in these long-lost orphans?’

‘If he is looking for missing children then why doesn’t he just go directly to the police? Such people would be very influential. The authorities wouldn’t dare to ignore him. Even the Brotherhood could only comply.’

‘Wait!’ Rick then seemingly noticed an important point.

‘Powerful, sneaky, secretive, interested in the origins of a child and does not want to deal with the Brotherhood.’

‘Strength requires money and resources. He is secretive because it would be bad for him if this is made public. He does not deal with the Brotherhood because he is too highly ranked. As for being interested in the children that the Brotherhood had gathered from different sources and channels…’

‘Wait.’

‘Since his strength is probably above supreme-class, he must be backed by power, wealth and position. Yet he avoided the Brotherhood and the police to secretly search for a certain important child … a child?’

Rick fiercely slapped his thigh as he an idea.

‘This guy is involved in the blood inheritance struggle of a big family!’

‘F*ck!’

Rick glared hard opposite him, at Layork and Felicia who were starting to neck.

However, his thoughts had long separated from this couple.

Perhaps in the entire Constellation, none of the fifteen million people would know of this day. A secret truth that would shake the kingdom and the continent was almost discovered by an insignificant gang leader.

Fry is the term for fish in the infant stage. You could think of them as baby fishes. Please don’t confuse it with cooking oil used for frying.



Chapter 28: The First Mystic Ability Test

What does despair feel like?

Ralf felt that he knew the answer to this question.

That immense pain when his larynx was shattered and torn apart by that female bartender from the Brotherhood (he did not know Jala’s name yet) made him feel as if it happened just five minutes ago.

And ever since then, it was as though he endured that pain every single second. Blood flowed in reverse from his throat into his lungs. The immense pain was transmitted to his brain from his throat. Even his airways were blocked.

He was unable to speak.

He was unable to breathe.

He was unable to move.

It was as though he was a heavily injured and dying stray dog that had simply been abandoned on Red Street Market.

Whether he eventually dies from pain, suffocation or choking, his hours are numbered.

The only thing that urged him to stay alive was his desire for life, which was born within him when he was roaming the streets of Camus Union during his childhood.

As a Psionic who controls the wind, he repeatedly used his psionic ability to push mouthful after mouthful of air full of dust, blood, and filth into his torn throat towards his lungs, as if he was squeezing a sponge.

He then squeezed out the exhaled breath from another wound on the back of his neck.

Inhale.

Exhale.

Inhale.

Exhale.

Every single ‘breath’ was accompanied by an immense, inhuman pain. It was like the sort of suffering one goes through when going back and forth between hell and earth.

‘I’m probably the first person to ever extend life using one’s psionic ability,’ Ralf thought with sorrow.

Ralf felt that his current condition was very similar to the stray dogs that lived by gathering rubbish in sewers.

The female bartender left.

The cop left.

A few groups of thugs walked past his heavily injured and dying body.

A scout turned him over and felt his mouth and nose for any breath.

An earth-shattering explosion traveled into his ears.

Ralf did not care.

He could only instinctively ‘breathe’ in mouthful after mouthful of air using his psionic ability under the immense pain.

He did that until daybreak, when Noumea, who was retreating in panic, hoisted up his ‘dead body’.

Noumea used to be a village hunter and was regarded as the coward among the Strongest Twelve. Ralf had always looked down on him, and the Phantom Wind Follower’s favorite pastime was to ridicule, insult, and bully him in the Brotherhood.

The most ironic fact was that in his last moments, this coward whom he had always scorned was the one who took care of his ‘dead body’.

Ralf was jolted awake by the immense pain that came from his legs.

His hands were tightly bound. When he opened his eyes, he was at the mortuary of the police station.

Then he saw Nikolay.

The head of Blood Bottle Gang’s Eight Cadres (Ralf did not know that five of them died during the battle on Red Street Market), Nikolay the ‘Red Viper’.

However, Nikolay only stared at him with a complicated gaze and shook his head disdainfully and with a fierce expression on his face.

“You are one of the few people from Blood Bottle Gang who survived,” the Red Viper said airily.

Ralf struggled, wanting to speak while enduring the pain in his throat, but he could only make nonsensical “Huh, huh” sounds.

He felt a flare of immense pain on his knee.

However, he could not feel anything below his knees.

“Look at you, Ralf. The best one and the only supra class elite among the Strongest Twelve.”

“The young man with endless glory, who was proudly recommended by Lady Catherine to the Air Mystic.”

The Red Viper softly tapped his face, gaze still complicated and full of hatred. He said mockingly, “Now, you are lying here like a dead body, unable to speak, unable to breathe, unable to move, and unable to eat. Why are you still alive?”

The Red Viper arched his brow and his countenance became hideous and frenzied, “Why did you survive instead of Kirks, Song, Sven, or Dorno? Why was it you? Why was it Catherine’s follower who survived instead of mine?”

Ralf widened his eyes, struggling with anger and pain. However, the immense pain and injury that came from two spots of his body prevented him from moving.

The Red Viper quelled his anger and instead started laughing loudly. He laughed jubilantly, happily, and insanely.

“Blood Bottle Gang suffered huge losses, and my forces were also considerably damaged,” he said softly. “If all of Catherine’s personnel were still around, she might be able to be promoted while using me as a stepping stone. This is a possibility.”

Nikolay’s expression became hideous.

“However, how would a Phantom Wind Follower who can’t talk, has no legs, is injured and on death’s door, be of her service? That’s why…” Nikolay extended his hands, and with a twisted face, squeezed the wounds on Ralf’s knees that had been cauterized to stop the bleeding. “Why don’t you just die in battle and disappear?”

“Unh…” Ralf shut his eyes tight in the midst of the immense pain and struggled with all his might, although his body could not move due to the heavy injuries. He did not do so to break free but to alleviate the pain in his knees.

Even the psionic ability to control the air that he relied on to ‘breathe’ was almost halted.

“My mood is really bad today. While cleaning up the mess, I faced obstacles everywhere.” Nikolay heaved a sigh and continued speaking, “But after getting rid of you, a genius well-regarded by Catherine, I’ll feel very happy.”

Seeing the hatred, pain, and anger in Ralf’s eyes, Nikolay sported an apologetic and resigned expression, he smilingly said, “There was no choice; they especially requested for a supra class elite and even emphasized that the wrists must be intact for them to obtain blood. Otherwise, I would really have liked to chop off your hands instead of your legs.”

In the end, he tapped Ralf’s face and spoke beside his ear in a deep voice, “I hope that you get along joyfully with the vampires.”

As Nikolay’s footsteps faded, two Blood Bottle Gang thugs walked up to him. One of them held a three-inch-long needle attached to a tube. The other grabbed Ralf’s lethargic wrist.

At that moment, Ralf felt great despair.

…..

Thales watched Ralf in a daze.

He had the urge to ask him about what happened to Jala after that, and about the result of their battle. Did Jala escape? Why was Ralf in this state? Was he not part of Blood Bottle Gang?

However, Thales hesitated, because he saw Ralf’s current state.

The legless man’s gaze was unfocused, and he could only convey his emotions through meaningless groans. His gaze was a mixture of despair, pain, regret, and sadness.

Thales still remember the Ralf he saw the night before.

Ralf was frivolous, confident, arrogant, and possessed extraordinary skills.

He moved about freely in the unending gusts of violent wind, leaving behind his trademark laughter.

But now…

“Ha… Ha… unh…” Ralf shut his eyes tight and started moaning in pain again.

The Phantom Wind Follower who was once wilful, mean, and fearless, did not exist anymore.

His lips were greenish-black and dry, a clear sign of severe dehydration. However, Thales could not find any water. He was also not sure if Ralf could still swallow in his current condition. Thales did not know how Ralf was even able to breathe.

The boy could only sit by the side in a daze and watch Ralf suffering in pain while struggling to live.

The second year after he transmigrated, a female child beggar had both her legs broken by Quide. Before dying, the poor girl wailed all night.

At that time, Thales was still in a state of ignorance and had only found very few memory fragments. He was panic-stricken, frightened by the horror of reality, and could only hide and shiver in a hole in the wall.

Then he had slept and listened to the girl wail through the entire night with a muddled mind.

It was similar to what was happening right now.

Afterward, he sometimes wondered why he did not have more courage at that moment to end the girl’s suffering.

Looking at Ralf’s disfigured state, Thales’ heart felt heavy.

‘No matter how many wrongdoings one has committed, no one deserves this kind of torture,’ he told himself.

In the end, Thales heaved a sigh and climbed towards Ralf’s side. He softly said, “Ralf… Midira Ralf.”

Although his consciousness was already slowly fading, at that moment, Ralf’s pupils instinctively became focused.

‘Who is this? Who still remembers me, a maimed person who is waiting to die?’

Thales softly drew out JC’s dagger and slowly held it against Ralf’s neck.

“I know that you are in a lot of pain right now, enduring torture and suffering that cannot be imagined by normal people. I can end your life and help free you from all of this.”

Ralf’s breathing, which was completed using his throat and his psionic ability, immediately became chaotic.

‘Torture. Suffering.

‘Escape?’

“However, I have to ask you seriously and carefully. Midira Ralf, are you willing to let me relieve you of your suffering like this? If you are willing, blink once. If you are not willing… I am only asking this once.”

With a solemn expression, Thales waited for Ralf’s reaction.

In the darkness, Ralf stared hard at the boy’s hazy profile before him.

Escape.

Ralf felt immense pain from his throat to his knees. Every single ‘breath’ tore open the wound on his throat. Every struggle affected the part where he was amputated on his knees.

He was thirsty, hungry, cold, in pain, and in despair, which was to him, the most terrifying emotion.

He recalled the sensation of wind fluttering past his body, the first time he killed a person with his psionic ability, the first time he entered Blood Bottle Gang, the first time he received a reward from his superior, the first time he made himself a man on top of a frail girl’s body, and the first time he saw the Air Mystic, as if he was on a pilgrimage.

He thought of the fear in his enemy’s gaze, the submissive gaze of his compatriots, ‘her’ expression, full of praise, and the proud and satisfied upwards curve of his lips whenever he heard gossip about the ‘Strongest Twelve’.

Those were past glories. And he has already lost all of those forever…

Had he not?

The next moment, Ralf’s gaze became determined. He used all his might to activate his greatly reduced psionic ability and drew a ‘breath’ into his half-crippled body.

And then, the Phantom Wind Follower trembled. With all his might while enduring the pain from the friction of his cheeks against the clamp lock, he raised his head with every ounce of his strength and earnestly gazed at Thales.

He prepared to blink. He just needed to blink once.

Once.

And then, Thales saw Ralf’s top and bottom lids move. They trembled and began moving towards the center.

Thales heaved a sad sigh in his heart and slowly clenched the dagger in his hand.

However, Ralf’s eyelids only trembled and stopped in the middle of his eyes.

There was one sliver of space left, but his eyelids did not close together.

It remained that way for a long, long time.

The man who was once the Phantom Wind Follower saw a flash of a scene that was either familiar or unfamiliar to him in front of his eyes. There were barren fields and dirty mud roads full of stray dogs and flies—that was the countryside of Camus Union, where he fought to survive when he was young.

During that incident, he was fighting for a black piece of bread against a gang of stray dogs, even though that bread had almost been completely devoured by a swarm of flies.

‘Those stray dogs were really fierce.’ Ralf thought quietly in the dungeon. ‘Their deafening growls, desperate bites, insane strength, however…’ Ralf subconsciously licked his upper teeth. ‘That bread tasted really horrible.’

Thales saw that Ralf’s expression was becoming distorted as it trembled.

His eyelids slowly relaxed, widened, and returned to their original positions.

*Boom!*

Like a leaking balloon, Ralf’s head, which was between the two clamp locks and which he had raised with great difficulty, suddenly fell backward. The back of his head hit the floor.

In the end, he did not blink.

Thales silently exhaled and slowly lowered the dagger in his hand.

However, it was as if Ralf did not feel the pain on the back of his head and the cuts on his cheeks.

His distorted face began trembling, along with his head.

“Ung… Unh—”

These were not moans.

Thales could not help but be stunned.

He saw Ralf shut his eyes in pain, his countenance trembled as he allowed the colorless liquid to slide down from his eyes ceaselessly.

“Unh, unh…”

His voice was very depressing and sorrowful.

He was crying.

The Phantom Wind Follower. Once, he was a powerful and endlessly praised Psionic, man, and warrior.

Now, he was shedding tears and crying.

Was he crying because of his weakness, or was it because of the pain he was feeling?

Right now, he was just like a common person, a normal person, or even a slightly weak citizen.

He cried as if he could no longer bear with the burden of his pain. Thales could only watch in a daze.

He watched as the man who could not talk nor breath normally fell on the floor and cried violently after passing up the chance to be freed.

Thales turned away gloomily. However, he tightened his grip on the dagger in his hand.

Ursula, Ned, and Kellet.

The child beggars who died in the sixth house, who did not even possess a surname, appeared one by one before his eyes.

He thought of his plight and then thought of Gilbert and Yodel.

The boy furrowed his brows and lowered his head to look at his hands. The new cut felt familiar, just like the burning heat just now.

At that moment, it was as if something settled within his heart.

Thales drew himself close to Ralf’s ear for the second time. “I understand,” he said softly.

Ralf was still crying in a manner as if he was crushed by his burdens.

“Then, are you willing to free yourself from these shackles?”

Ralf’s crying paused for a moment. It did not stop but slowly became softer.

The little girl with the broken legs, and almost every single child who died in the Abandoned Houses in the past four years, flashed in front of Thales’ eyes.

Shrill cries and despaired wails rang from outside the prison cell again.

‘This f*ck*ng world.’

Thales did not know what was inside the dungeon. However, his gaze when looking at Ralf became simpler and clearer.

And then, Thales looked earnestly at the Phantom Wind Follower who could not fly anymore and spoke with determination, “Free yourself from these shackles. And then, with this battered body, continue struggling in this world and strive to stay alive. See how much crueler the world can be. Are you willing?”

Ralf stopped crying.

He was unable to move his head. He could only move his gaze to look at the boy beside him in a daze.

He heard the boy speak slowly and clearly, “This might not be freedom. There may be a huge price to pay. You could even die immediately. As for me, I am only doing this for myself.”

Thales then lowered his head and said slowly, “However, I can try and give you a chance, let you leave these shackles behind and struggle to live one more time. Are you willing?”

Ralf stared hard into the boy’s eyes.

Although there were tears lingering in his eyes, at that moment, Ralf suddenly felt like laughing. He felt as if the pain in his throat and knees was slowly numbing.

‘Those stray dogs.

‘Those stray dogs that fought for the bread with him.

‘Those stray dogs, in the end…’

Ralf managed to take a ‘breath’. A strange burst of joy bloomed in his heart.

‘In the end.

‘They faced a tragic end.’

Ralf, who was lying on the floor, raised his gaze again while trembling and stared straight at Thales.

The next moment, the Phantom Wind Follower slowly blinked, clearly, in a manner that there was no mistaking his action.

Everyone has blinked their eyes countless times in their lives. These blinks were extremely insignificant.

However, Ralf had perhaps performed the most important blink in his life.

Ralf slowly lowered his head.

Thales smiled, a lot of the gloominess in his heart dispersed. He nodded curtly. “Alright, I understand.”

…..

“At first, I thought Her Highness woke up ahead of schedule. But now, it seems like that is not the case.”

Chris frowned tightly in a dim room on the second floor of Vine Manor.

Before him sat a network of countless blood vessels in a complicated pattern connected to a massive, brownish-black coffin that was as tall as a person—three meters wide and six meters tall.

At that moment, an unbroken tremor shook the coffin from within. “I tried to connect to Her Highness’ consciousness, but it still remains muddled and unclear. There was only hunger and killing instinct. No matter how I tried to communicate with and comfort her, it was still the same!” Chris put a tube of blood down, his countenance became more and more solemn. “If this continues, Her Highness will only use up her remaining strength and blood supply ahead of schedule!”

Rolana looked shocked. The red-headed Blood Clanswoman said anxiously, “There must be something that stimulated Her Highness, but we did not do anything!”

Chris’ eyes were shining with a bright light. The previous still and lifeless expression in his eyes had now disappeared without a trace. The old man spoke resolutely, “Not us! Her Highness only began having this reaction five minutes ago. At that time—”

Chris’ expression changed drastically. As if he suddenly thought of something, he turned his head and shouted to Istrone who stood behind him with a solemn expression.

“That young child! Even we can smell the fragrance of his blood from two floors away. With Her Highness’ sense of smell, it would have been… Where is the young child?”

Istrone was anxious and agitated. Looking at the excited Chris, he answered instinctively, “Just now, it seemed he accidentally cut himself. Then he pulled off the half-disabled supra class’ phlebotomy device and said some weird things. I didn’t listen closely. And then he—”

The expressionless Chris did not continue to listen to Istrone’s explanation. The vibrations and dull tapping sounds continued to resound from the suspicious coffin. The old man rudely and directly cut Istrone off. “Bring the child up. No, Isa, you stay here; let Rolana go.” Looking at the gigantic coffin that was vibrating more and more vigorously, Chris’ eyes shone with a strange light, as if there were sparks in them. “What Her Highness craves for… is his blood.”

…..

“This plan is very risky.” Thales calmly explained to Ralf who was on the floor. It was as if he had returned to the sixth house and was using everything at his disposal to protect those good, naive and innocent child beggars who had been suffering in hell since they were born.

“However, it is more unwise to sit here and be vulnerable to capture while waiting for some miracle to happen.”

Ralf only quietly watched the boy whose gaze was so very different from the average person. With effort, he took a ‘breath’.

‘That serious face of his,’ Ralf smiled in his heart and thought, ‘definitely isn’t inferior to Big Sister.’

The Phantom Wind Follower was not aware that, after facing a choice between life and death, he felt a lot more at ease.

Thales continued to explain detachedly as if he was not the one who was speaking. “I don’t know how much strength you have left, but I estimate that it wouldn’t be a lot. And the capability of that old man… So, neither both of us taking a reckless risk nor passively waiting would be ideal for the situation now. Our best, and most opportune moment would be when my rescue army arrives. At the moment they break in—”

“You won’t be able to wait for your rescue army, little mortal brat.”

A cold female voice interrupted Thales.

Ralf’s face immediately tensed up.

Thales was momentarily stunned. Then, he turned his head in disbelief and looked towards the door of the prison cell.

Rolana Corleone stood outside the door, wearing a good-looking equestrian suit. She seductively grazed her lips with the index finger of her slim and beautiful right hand. At the same time, she yanked the lock of the cell door open with her now turned fearsome, sharp, clawed right hand.

“Istrone told you before, right? That no matter what you do, we will be able to hear it, Young Sir who played a trick on Istrone.”

As if mocking him, Rolana laughed lightly and, with her attractively slim body, took elegant and sexy steps from the open cell door into the prison cell. “Too bad. Perhaps, after you grow a few years older, even I will be seduced by you. But right now, you are about to become Her Highness’ fragrant and condensed energy drink. Perhaps the adorable Rolana would be able to take a sip too?”

Looking at Rolana, who appeared suddenly, Thales understood that she could subdue him at any time.

The boy heaved a deep sigh that seemed sincere and regretful.

“Ralf,” he said mildly, without a trace of anxiety in his voice, “I need ten seconds.”

‘Ten seconds?’

Suddenly, Rolana felt uneasy.

She thought of Istrone who had been duped.

‘What other cards could he have in his hands? The half-disabled supra class mortal creature who is trapped in the Night Wing Stone Lock?’

However, the cunning Rolana did not want to take risks. Her expression immediately became fierce and determined.

‘This little devil, he’s trying to make himself sound mysterious!’

In an instant, her attractive figure appeared before Thales’ eyes.

‘Wait till Her Highness sucks you dry into a mummy. See if you can still—’

But at that moment, a gust of strange, violent wind stirred up in the tiny prison cell.

*Whoosh!*

The fire on the torches swayed, and there were even a few times where they were almost extinguished.

The violent wind made Rolana stagger three steps backward. In deep shock, she immediately grabbed onto the bars beside her and stood her ground with all her might.

‘Is this… psionic ability?

‘Impossible, it is impossible that this child is a Psionic.

‘Then, it has to be…’ With effort, Rolana looked towards the supra class elite who was locked onto the floor beside Thales by the Night Wind Stone Lock. ‘It has to be him!

‘Surprisingly, he still retained some strength, even in this state.

‘It’s useless.’ Rolana relaxed and thought cheerily, ‘You are all locked up and heavily injured. Even if you have a psionic ability, how long can it last?

‘On the other hand, that young trickster… Later, even if I have to risk being reprimanded by Chris, I still want to drink a mouthful of your blood first.

‘I will definitely make sure I leave a deep impression of it on you!’ Rolana thought furiously.

“Then, let’s begin.”

Thales looked in front of him, at Rolana who was impeded by the violent winds. With a serene expression, he turned his dagger over.

Ten.

Under Ralf’s puzzled gaze, he grabbed the dagger’s blade with his unblemished right hand.

Nine.

“Good luck to both of us,” he said.

Eight.

‘My first mystic ability trial.’

Seven.

‘It starts now.’

Six.

Thales stared at the black, stone shackles that held Ralf, but Ralf’s face was red. He stared fixedly at Rolana, and the violent billows continued to buffet.

With a cold façade, Rolana grabbed tightly onto the bars beside her. Her left hand began transforming into fearsome, bright red claws.

Five.

‘I want to break his shackles,’ Thales thought quietly.

‘And save this man who has nothing left.’

Four.

‘If it is just as I predict it to be…’ Thales recalled various life-and-death situations in his mind.

Such as when Quide’s hand strangled his neck.

When Asda’s hand slowly tightened.

And the bloody scene in his distant memory, as well as the gentle person who still harbored all those adolescent delusions who existed in his memory, and whose name he could not remember.

Three.

Thales grit his teeth and closed his eyes. His right hand abruptly grabbed onto the metal hasp.

A wave of burning heat appeared from the metal.

But he clenched his teeth and endured it.

Rolana felt something. She turned her head in shock as she realized that the grill she had grabbed onto was vibrating.

‘What’s going on?’ the Blood Clanswoman thought anxiously.

‘That half-crippled man, how strong is his psionic ability?’

Two.

*Bang!*

The bar, along with Rolana’s hand, shattered into countless tiny pieces.

As Rolana, who could no longer stand steadily, pressed onto the severed wound on her arm and screamed shrilly, she was blown out of the dungeon by the violent wind summoned by the psionic ability in an instant.

One.

Rolana’s shrill and crazed growl resounded beside his ears.

The burning sensation attacked her.

Zero.

‘Light.’ Thales thought with his now hazy consciousness, ‘So much light.’

…..

In the room on the second floor with the huge coffin, Chris’ countenance suddenly turned strange.

“What is Rolana trying to do?” he said coldly, looking at the gigantic coffin that kept emitting dull tapping sounds.

“Perhaps she’s getting a taste of the food,” Istrone answered carefully, he could feel the elder’s anxiousness. He continued speaking, “Towards delicacies, she had always… No! They are—”

Istrone’s words were cut off by something from the outside world as their expressions turned into that of shock.

*Boom!*

A loud bang that sounded like an explosion echoed from underground.

A cloud of dust burst in violently from outside the door.

The two Blood Clansmen, both young and old, changed expressions at the same time. Then, they exchanged glances.

‘Something happened in the dungeon.’

The next moment, they appeared outside the manor!

When Istrone saw the scene in front of his eyes clearly, he opened his mouth wide in shock, in a manner that was completely uncharacteristic of him.

Under the moonlight, the supra class mortal creature without legs and who had a tattoo on his face, the man who was once the Phantom Wind Follower, Midira Ralf, was seen to have escaped from all his shackles.

He was flying in the sky by riding on the violent winds while holding the little mortal child tightly under his armpit with a determined expression on his face.

…..

Not far away, while Gilbert was riding a horse and leading thirty Swordsmen of Eradication who charged at full throttle, his expression changed.

“Bloodline Lamp.” Amidst the whirling sound of the wind, he spoke in a low voice to the female official beside him.

Jines, who was galloping along with her horse, looked at the Bloodline Lamp in Gilbert’s arms with a solemn expression.

The flame of the lamp became red.

It was slanted.

“That direction—” Gilbert recalled. His expression was solemn.

“It’s Covendier Family’s Vine Manor!”

The female official growled angrily and whipped her mount.

“Who cares about which family it belongs to? Even if we are facing the Eckstedt’s Walton family…

“…we still have to break in!”

Gilbert nodded, a determined and fierce expression appearing on his face.

“All teams, change direction and follow me! No need to preserve horsepower! Charge forward with increased speed! Prepare for battle!”

“The descendants of Disaster Sword want to imitate a type of the Power of Eradication?” Kohen raised his eyebrow. “Imitate? Does that mean, this type of power has a prototype to be imitated?”

“Prototype…” Zedi thought about it seriously and nodded. “Yes, you can say that—there is a type of superpower that can act as a prototype, and one can imitate it.”

Kohen furrowed his eyebrows and muttered, “Superpower?”

The police officer said in a puzzled tone, “This was how we addressed the Power of Eradication a long time ago. So the prototype of the superpower first appeared before the Battle of Eradication… That was at least seven hundred years ago?”

“Longer, it was a lot longer than what you imagined.” Zedi sucked in a breath as he recalled his discussion with the other scions.

He then said faintly, “The ‘prototype’ you mentioned appeared from the Age of Feudal Kings to the Ancient Empire, but the most famous record was during the climax of the Ancient Empire’s first civil strife— there was a person who possessed that ‘prototype’ superpower, who led the army into the Capital of Triumph and cut off the supreme emperor’s head.”

‘Cut off… an emperor’s… Head?’

Kohen widened his mouth in shock.

“Emperor? I would still believe you if you are talking about the small and weak Final Empire, but that was the great Ancient Empire! Why did history class never mention this?”

“There was more than one time where an emperor was attacked by assassins during the two dynasties of the empire, and there were only two successful cases. As to why you did not know about this at all as a noble…” Zedi put on a smug smile.

“First of all, it is because of the reason that is known to everyone, Constellation has very little historic information on the two empire dynasties. If you want to find the most complete historical material and ancient books, you would have to go to Mane et Nox Dynasty’s Flourish and Decay Pavilion or the Tower of Eradication’s Truth Library.

“Secondly, the Jade Star Royal Family is the descendant of the Caros Imperial Family, after all. Even if they know about this, do you think that the supreme king would happily put the phrase ‘the emperor was beheaded by the army’ into the books?

“Let us return to our original topic.” Zedi sat down cross-legged—this was Shao’s way of sitting down. Compared to his other method of sitting on his heels, Zedi felt that this sort of Far Eastern manner of sitting made him feel particularly like an expert—and he patted his saber.

“I heard that the fellow who murdered the emperor relied on this mysterious prototype superpower and defeated almost every one of his opponents in that era. Even the wizards had no choice but to be extremely careful when they met him.”

“Every opponent?” Kohen asked in surprise, “What made this prototype so powerful?”

“I am not clear about that.” Zedi furrowed his eyebrows. “There were records written in Crassus’ own notes that mentioned this: The biggest characteristic of the superpower was that it did not have any special characteristics.

“No special characteristics?”

Zedi spread his hands and said irresponsibly, “Anyway, that was what Crassus had written over a hundred years ago.”

“It does not seem right.” Kohen furrowed his brows and said skeptically, “If this sort of superpower was indeed so powerful, would there be no one who would compete to learn and master it during the past thousand years, making it the most popular Power of Eradication now?”

“Right, why was it not circulated widely? This is the strange part.” Zedi had a mysterious expression on his face, as if he wanted Kohen to ask him about it. “We have clarified this point.”

Kohen raised an eyebrow and crossed his hands in front of his chest, refusing to ask Zedi.

The corners of Zedi’s mouth curled up and he furrowed his brows as he stared resolutely at Kohen.

But the latter was still showing no interest in knowing, as if he came to the library only for a stroll and to listen to a story.

Finally, Zedi rolled his eyes at Kohen. He still could not resist the urge to pour out what was on his mind and said resignedly, “Crassus’ notes were quite vague, but only the information on the awakening and increase of levels for this power were recorded clearly. That was the research done by him and another scion at that time.”

Kohen stared at him, filled with curiosity.

Zedi opened his mouth and quoted a phrase that sounded like a verse from the Far Eastern countries, “Experience life or death to become extraordinary, experience living and dying in order to scale a peak.”

Kohen widened both of his eyes and his mouth, then shook his head twice.

‘I do not understand.’

Zedi sighed. “Our usual Power of Eradication, including the Four Main Original Superpowers, all have to rely on our sword style that never faded away as well as combat practices to be awakened.

“But this type of ‘prototype’ cannot be awakened through practice, and it is also unable to have any sort of increase in power based on our proficiency with it.” Zedi narrowed his eyes in an enigmatic manner.

“As a Power of Eradication, only when its wielder is in grave danger and is about to die…

“Would it have a slight chance of being awakened.”

Kohen widened his eyes.

“Experience life or death to become extraordinary, experience living and dying in order to scale a peak—it can only be awakened in situations where its wielder will most certainly die.”

The wide Truth Library was filled with silence.

Kohen widened his mouth in disbelief only after three seconds had passed. “It cannot be real! So those who had this prototype Power of Eradication are all…”

“Yes.” Zedi furrowed his brows tightly together and spoke a few words in doubt and confusion.

“People who experienced death.”

Kohen touched his abdomen with a ghastly expression on his face. There, on his abdomen, was a wound which had been formed when he was pierced by the Disaster Swordsman of Blood Bottle Gang. It was seemingly throbbing in pain.

Zedi looked perplexed when he said, “The Awakened who had this prototype Power of Eradication were the small handful of lucky ones on the battlefield. They had to suffer fatal injuries to be able to awaken, and I guess that more than half of those Awakened died from their injuries not long after they experienced their awakening.

“Let’s say, for example, your throat has been slashed, but you do not die immediately and such a power is awakened within you. Then, you would have recuperative abilities comparable to a dragon’s. You would be able to stand up, alive and kicking after all of your injuries are healed?” Kohen’s brows were wrinkled together. “It does not sound like something a human can do.”

The police shook his head in disbelief… he could not understand the meaning of this power.

“But at the end of the day, it did appear,” his teacher hung his head and said.

“I still have another guess that Shao very much agrees with.” Under Kohen’s gaze, Zedi held his breath and slowly relayed his inference.

“The stronger the people are, like those in supreme class or supra class, the terms and conditions for them to upgrade this Power of Eradication would be harsher. The ‘deadly situation’ needed would be even more brutal, and the mortality rate would also be higher… That was why Crassus thought of imitation instead of copying it down to the very last detail.”

Kohen sighed. “I guess, that sort of frantic and ruthless vibe was a residual effect of this power, which ‘courts death’?”

Zedi nodded. “That was the reason why even after the lucky ones survived and obtained the power, they still had to go through even more devastating deaths again and again if they wanted to increase their level and become stronger… Very few people survived, the others were…

Zedi sighed. “Thus, it is absolutely impossible for it to circulate in a large-scale.”

“Do you not think that it is very contradicting?!” Kohen raised his hand and objected from the floor. “If you want to awaken that power, you must seek death! If you want to become stronger, you must also seek death! Then, what is the purpose of me practicing this Power of Eradication?”

“Haha, becoming stronger is not necessarily just for surviving.” Zedi Taffner, the Tower of Eradication’s supreme class scion, chuckled. “Do not underestimate a person’s determination in pursuing power and becoming a powerful person.

“Was ‘Disaster Sword’ Crassus not an example? Why do you think he wanted to imitate this highly dangerous Power of Eradication?”

Kohen furrowed his brows.

‘Power?

‘Become stronger?

‘Raphael…

‘What is your purpose anyway…?’

Kohen touched his head and thought of a question.

“Other than that person who murdered the emperor, are there anymore records of the others who Awakened? Who is the first Awakened in history?”

“Did I not tell you?” Zedi scratched his head gracelessly. If Director Lorbec was here, he would recognize that this head-scratching motion was almost exactly the same as Kohen’s. “We flipped through every ancient book, Shao even went to Mane et Nox Dynasty’s Flourish and Decay Pavilion…

“The first suspected record appeared during the Uncivilized Period, during the Iron Blood King’s world famous ‘Mankind’s Final Defensive Line’. A sixteen-year-old soldier who was seriously injured awakened to a type of superpower that could not be upgraded, and he became a laughingstock for a while. The second record appeared during the Age of Feudal Kings, before the Holiness Exorcism Campaign. There was one eighteen-year-old ordinary class infantryman who came back alive from the orcs’ tight encirclement. He then mastered the superpower and became a supra class.”

Kohen scratched his own head. “I guess, apart from ‘experiencing death’ and also the fact that they were all very young, you have not managed to find anything else, right?”

Zedi stared at him for a really long time.

“No, we did find something,” Zedi muttered.

“All of these people shared a common characteristic.”

“What common characteristic?” Kohen’s spirits were immediately lifted as he widened his eyes.

Zedi gave him a mysterious smile. “The two people mentioned just now fought against the orcs. It was before a period of time when mankind and orcs went into battle where they would awaken to this prototype superpower.

“The crucial point is right here.”

“Wait a minute, you!” Kohen looked at his teacher’s evil grin and recalled his teacher’s horrid interests. He became wary and could not help but gulp in difficulty. “I recognize this expression…”

“One person was within the tight encirclement, another was on the defense line.” The police raised both of his hands and crossed them in front of his chest as he made an exaggerated defensive motion. He continued to furrow his brows tightly. “Are you going to say…”

Zedi raised his eyebrow and stared at him.

“It was compulsory to do some indescribable things with the orcs… in order to awaken to that prototype, right?”

After Kohen had finished speaking, a familiar sound of the wind suddenly attacked him, just as he expected!

*Thud!*

Kohen raised his hands proficiently and blocked Zedi’s hand strike.

Kohen snorted and laughed. ‘As expected, the same move used twice would be ineffective against me…’

*Slam!*

Kohen’s face went pale as he placed his hand on his abdomen. He stared at the scabbard in Zedi’s left hand in disbelief.

‘This guy…

‘Actually cheated…’

“What have you been thinking all day long?!” Zedi pulled back the scabbard he thrusted out and said exasperatedly.

“In the West Line Battlefield, the soldiers were all crude and large.” Kohen rubbed his abdomen in pain. “You had to be proficient with some of their nonsense in order to blend in.”

“Back to the topic!” Zedi said, exasperated.

Kohen gave a dispirited smile and sat back up again.

“Remember the fellow who beheaded the emperor? We have records on that person who murdered the emperor.” Zedi sighed. “He was also a knight and a Northlander.”

Kohen looked confused.

Zedi narrowed his eyes. “The knight whom he served as his master already died when he was still a page. All along, no one taught that he was the person who murdered the emperor…”

Kohen shook his head. “So?”

Zedi exhaled. “That person who murdered the emperor only learned a basic sword style.”

Under Kohen’s curious gaze, Zedi’s eyes shone with a bright light.

“The ancient sword style to defeat the orcs.

“The sword style that is the origin of superpowers…”

Kohen came to a realization as he widened his eyes in shock. They could not have been any wider.

Zedi gently held onto the hilt of his sword and said, “The Northland Military Sword Style.”

…

Thales lifted his head.

“If I die here, war between Eckstedt and Constellation would certainly erupt,” he said steadily and calmly. “Constellation would be too busy to care for itself, let alone travel across the ocean to invade your country.”

“Two hundred years of prison life taught me one thing.” The vampire lightly pulled her cape tighter around her body, making her curvy figure even clearer and more alluring. However, her tone was very scary. “The greatest wealth is the power in my own hands.

“Do not underestimate the temptation of power,” Serena said indifferently, “It can turn people crazy.”

“Do you know how many casualties this will cause?” Thales asked calmly.

Serena seemed like she was grieving when she sighed. “Yes, all those precious lives and blood sacrifices… but it is as a Far Eastern saying goes: The great general will achieve outstanding battle achievements on ten thousand dead bodies and skeletons.”

Thales lifted his head and his gaze was filled with determination. “Lives are not toys that you are allowed to simply knead and play around with, ugly-faced woman.”

“Do not call me that, I will get angry,” Serena said quietly.

Thales ignored her. “You do not have the right, no one has that kind of right.”

“Too bad.” Serena’s eyes sparkled with exotic colors. “Since ancient times, many people have had this kind of right.”

Just as Thales was about to continue speaking to delay time, Serena decided not to bother wasting her breath on him again. In the next moment, she only said one sentence slowly, “I finally succeeded.”

In his heart, Thales was puzzled.

But he understood it shortly after!

He suddenly realized to his surprise that he was unable to move a single step.

Thales suddenly broke out in a cold sweat from fear.

‘What is going on?’

Thales wanted to use a wood chip to cut off the rope tying his hands, but even his fingers were stiff!

“Generally speaking, my ‘Halting Gaze’ only requires a few seconds to take effect on weak people.” Serena walked nonchalantly towards Thales and took away the wood chip in his hand under his shocked gaze.

“But you are indeed a real descendant of the Empire. It took me such a long time to freeze you.

“Compared to my younger sister’s power, this is not really a useful power in battle.” Serena sneered.

“Why was I wasting my breath? Did you really think you were the only one who was stalling for time?” Serena said coldly, “Every second that I have to speak with you disgusts me, little sh*t.”

Thales’ face was pale as he stared at Serena, but his neck was extremely stiff.

Serena smiled faintly.

“Are you ready to welcome your death? Second prince?”

‘How-how did it become this way?’

Thales could slowly move now, but he had already lost his trump card.

His heart was filled with incomparable remorse.

‘If only I had…

‘No!’

He suddenly came to a realization.

‘It is still not too late now!’

Thales clenched his teeth and squeezed out a few words from the gaps between his teeth. “Ugly… faced… woman…”

Serena no longer concealed her expression. She blatantly revealed her hatred and disgust.

“Damned little sh*t, I really want to suck you dry…”

Thales suddenly had an idea.

‘Right.

‘Quickly, come and suck my blood.

‘If that is the case…’

Serena’s face got closer to him, and she sniffed him deeply as if she was smelling a delicacy. Her long lashes scraped his eyebrows.

Yet, Serena did not do as he wished.

“No worries, I will not let you bleed and allow you to use that psionic ability… Such a shame, isn’t it?” Serena caressed his face and slowly blew air into his ear. “But still, I have spoken the truth…

“Your blood is really nutritious.”

The next moment, Thales’ neck was forcefully gripped by Serena and he was lifted up into the air!

‘Why is it this again!’ Thales cursed in his heart!

He was not able to breathe once more.

Serena sighed.

“Do you really think that I like to disguise myself as a little girl who cannot speak properly, and that I like holding back my disgust towards acting like a spoiled child in front of you?”

In the blink of an eye, Serena’s gaze became cold. “Or maybe, you thought that I would be really patient and wait for the day you become king. Then, I would wait until you become old and greying to give me a team of mercenaries, which would be of no use in restoring my throne?”

Her grip became even tighter!

“Serena? Little girl?

“How dare you address me like that? I have lived longer than the sum of all your ancestors’ lives!” she said fiercely, almost crushing Thales’ throat.

“For your rudeness,” she said coldly, “I will let you taste the pain of being on the verge of death.”

Thales kicked his legs in pain.

But, his hands were still tied firmly together and they could not even put up an effective struggle!

‘I have gone too far,’ he thought in pain.

“A very long time ago, Hestad told me that there was a Darkhan from a tribe who was proficient in battle, and he once said something like this to his best ally,” Serena stared at Thales’s struggles nonchalantly while she said coldly, “For the sake of our former friendship…

“I grant you a death without bleeding.”

…

“Oh! That silly ‘Get Thrashed Sword Style’, which fell into ruin over the course of a few thousand years?” Kohen placed his fist on his palm in realization.

“I thought no one ever practiced it again ever since the Quiquer’s Holiness Exorcism Campaign over three thousand years ago, which was during the Age of Feudal Kings and after we thoroughly defeated the orcs!”

“Be more respectful!” Zedi said sternly.

“Even though many of its sword moves, which had the initial purpose of resisting the orcs and Great Dragon seemed childish and ridiculous in the subsequent wars,” the Tower of Eradication’s scion stood upright before Kohen’s eyes, then seriously and solemnly said, “It was after all, the ‘origin sword’ for superpowers. Since all Four Main Original Superpowers were born from this, it would not be impossible for it to give birth to a fifth foreign type.”

“Wait a minute!” Kohen came to a realization and furrowed his brows. “According to this, we can already deduce the necessary requirements for such a prototype Power of Eradication to be awakened?”

“Yes.” Zedi nodded seriously.

“Firstly, you must be very young. Maybe above twelve years old and below twenty years old. Also, you cannot have awakened to any form of Power of Eradication before.

“Secondly, you must have completely inherited the foundation of the Northland Military Sword Style.

“Next, and this is the most important part. You must experience death but you cannot die immediately.

“Finally, you must have—what you said, a powerful recovery ability that is comparable to the Great Dragon’s—to come back alive from deadly injuries to ensure that your awakening is not the last scene of your life.

“And then, you have to repeat the entire process again.”

The scion lifted his head and took a look at the sky outside the window.

The sun had almost set.

Zedi recalled the figure who carried his sword in silence, and also the oath he took when he left.

“I will find that power.

“No matter how difficult it is, and what kind of price I have to pay.

“If this is the path that has been set before me…”

Zedi Taffner lowered his head and sighed.

“But this is absolutely impossible.”

After a long period of silence.

Kohen’s expression was serious. He was not impolite this time around, but he used honorifics as he spoke, “Teacher, does this prototype Power of Eradication have a name?”

Zedi paused for a moment before he slowly nodded.

“Yes.

“That person who murdered the emperor gave it a name.”

Kohen’s expression became grave. “What is it called?”

“It is related to the legend that you are very familiar with, having heard it for many times,” Zedi said faintly. “It is about death.

“It is the legend of the Bright God Church during ancient times. After people die, if their souls could not return to the Kingdom of God, they would then go down to hell.

“At the gateway of hell, before the seven kings’ residence, a dangerous and scary river would flow. Above the river was a crafty ferryman who rowed his boat all year long. He was in charge of receiving and guiding these souls of the dead.

“That river is called… Hell’s River.”

Kohen secretly trembled.

That was the story he heard from his mother, teacher, and even servants since he was young.

‘Maybe… that is not just a legend?’

“So, when you see Hell’s River, you also see death.

“However, the person who murdered the emperor believed that, inevitably, there would be some people possessing souls that not even Hell’s River would be willing to receive. The ferryman of Hell’s River would then send those souls back to the human world.

“They had seen Hell’s River, but returned from their deaths.”

Kohen widened his eyes.

Zedi enunciated each word clearly.

“Therefore…

“The Power of Eradication obtained by coming back from death was named by the person who murdered the emperor as…

“The Sin of Hell’s River.”

…

Thales was struggling against the rope binding his hands.

His blue lips were trembling as he resisted powerlessly despite doing everything he could before this unmatched power.

Goosebumps rose on his skin due to the great pressure. His bones were chafing ruthlessly against each other due to his tight joints, and blood flowed to the surface of his skin. His heartbeat became increasingly faster as his heart throbbed under great pressure.

Stars and darkness emerged before his eyes as his vision slowly faded away.

It was as if there was a huge layer of glass between the air and his nose and mouth, which was stopping him from breathing.

His grey eyes trembled as he watched Serena’s grip become tighter and tighter.

Thales was still struggling as hard as he could. His legs would not stop kicking as he wanted to struggle free of this dark and despairing shadow of death.

But things became increasingly darker before his eyes.

Until he lost his vision.

Brain activity became exponentially tougher, harder, and slower because his mind was lacking oxygen.

His thoughts were no longer clear.

His memories started to become jumbled as numerous fragments of memories emerged prominently in his mind and gradually intersected with each other.

His heart was throbbing like crazy as it wanted to deliver more oxygen to the brain.

Yet, it was all futile.

Then, Constellation’s only heir, Thales Jadestar, stopped struggling.

His eyeballs turned upwards and his legs slumped down powerlessly. His shoulders went slack and he became still, like a calm atmosphere that appeared when dead silence filled an area.

Serena put on a satisfied smile.

The sun had set in the east, and the dark night finally arrived.

Thales TherrenGirana Kessel Jadestar…

Was dead.



"No! Absolutely no way! Arthur! Do you know how dangerous it is to become an Adventurer? You've just gotten back after we all thought you were dead and now you're saying you want to go get yourself killed out there? No way! Absolutely not . "

My mother was on the verge of tears while she said this . She had never been good at controlling her emotions . Eleanor was besides her, clutching onto her leg .

"Mama, don't be angry . Bruhder not bad a person! Uuu… Mama, don't cry . "

Director Goodsky had left the manor after my announcement . I could tell she still wanted to ask me a lot of questions but we excused ourselves to have a family talk . We were currently inside my parent's room with my mother standing up in front of me, forbidding me to even think about doing anything remotely dangerous .

Father was a bit more rational . I could tell he didn't like the idea as well, but he couldn't really see any reason for me not to be an adventurer besides my age .

I wasn't going to debate with my mother . She was saying all of this because she was worried and I could never blame her for that . It was something I had expected and I wanted to slowly ease her into the idea, but the meeting with Director Goodsky threw the timing off of everything .

After being silent the whole time, my father finally spoke up . "Honey, let's hear Arthur out at least . I'm not saying I agree to him becoming an adventurer but don't you think we should at least listen to what he has to say?"

"How can you still say that after what happened that day!" my mother yelled, breaking down into a fit of sobs .

I looked to my father for answers, curious about what she was talking about, but he simply shook his head and comforted my mother .

It seemed like a good hour before she had calmed down enough for us to speak again .

I grabbed my mother's hands . "Mom . I wasn't planning on leaving tomorrow . I was looking forward to spending a few months at home with you guys . "

She was still silent, but her face softened a little at that and I just gave her a warm smile, Sylvie followed suit and began licking her hand .

"What I meant by becoming an adventurer was so that I can get some experience . After being in the Elf Kingdom for three years, I missed a lot about what I should know about this world of ours . I just thought that becoming an adventurer would be the best way to gain some practical experience," I urged, not letting go of Mother's hands .

"I understand where you're coming from, Arthur . Although I was a bit older, I was also itching to get some real life experience in fighting as soon as I awakened as a mage," he reminisced . "But your mother is also right in that it is dangerous, and unpredictable . "

My mother nodded her head vigorously at this .

I stayed silent for a little bit as I pondered .

"Dad . Mom . What if I were to have some sort of guard or supervisor with me? Would that make you feel a bit more at ease with this whole idea?"

"…""Hmm… You know, that's not a bad idea . " I could almost see the gears in my father's head wind as he began thinking of potential candidates .

"B-but… I still won't be able to see you for three years!" My mother began to protest again .

Shaking my head, I say to her . "Mom, I'm not going to go on long trips or go on dangerous missions to faraway places . I'll try to come back every few months, maybe even more frequently than that, depending on what I do . "

"Bruhder, are you leaving?" My sister had an expression as if she had just been told that Santa didn't exist .

I started to panic . "Nono Ellie I'm staying here . You'll be seeing your brother a lot from now on, okay?"

Apparently, both my mother and father had told Eleanor a lot of stories about me and how strong and smart I was . One of Ellie's favorite bedtime stories was how I saved Mother from a bunch of bad guys on top of a cliff and that I got hurt so it'll take me some time to come back home . Eventually, I had become some sort of hero to my sister .

I look back at my mother . Her face was considerably more at ease after talking about this . I guess she had just assumed the worst-case scenario and thought I wanted to slay the world's strongest evil at the age of eight or something .

"Why did you want to be an Adventurer before even going to school anyways? Wasn't it usually the opposite?" my mother softly muttered .

"Dad's reason was a part of it; I want to test my skills out in real life situations . Also, Mom, I want to at least try to fit in with everyone when I go to school . It would be a lot harder to fit in if I began school at the age of eight . I don't think I'll be able to make much friends with such a big age difference . "

It was a very pitiful excuse, but, for once, my mother gave me a look of understanding . I guess it was a mother's worst nightmare for her child to become a loner .

It wasn't a complete lie because I said it thinking of Sylvia's dying wish . She had wanted me to enjoy life and have a life not just of training . This was a promise that I planned on keeping no matter what .

"Besides, I'm going to be here for a couple of months anyway . Who know, maybe you'll get sick of me by then and throw me out before I even get the chance to leave," I winked at my mother .

That earned me a thump on the head but she chuckled as well . "You! You're just like your father at times like these . Thank God you at least have my intelligence . " She gave me a big hug, leaving me with a warm feeling that I still wasn't used to .

"Hey! What about my intelligence! He was gifted with my adept abilities in fire too!" My father protested .

"Hmph! My son got his deviant powers from me . " Mother just turned me away from my father and just stuck her tongue out at him .

"Ellie too! Bleh!" My sister copied my mother and stuck her tongue out at my devastated father .

"Sniff! No ones on my side . " He just playfully cried, trying to hug his my daughter . This left us all in a fit of laughter .

The next day was a Sunday, leaving my father with the day off . Both the Leywin and Helstea family were dining together for breakfast . "So did you guys settle on what to do about Arthur?" Vincent asked, half chewing on his omelet .

Tabitha shook her head; "I swear . Sometimes, I have such a hard time believing you're a noble with your horrible dining habits, dear . ""Kukuku, don't worry . At least your husband's better than mine . Remember that one dinner party where Rey spit out his food from laughing so hard? I had to use Ellie as an excuse to leave the table because I was so embarrassed," My mother just sighed .

"Cough! Anyways! Yes, after talking about it yesterday night, we agreed to let him become an adventurer under some conditions, Vince . " My father just lightly blushed as he tried to switch back the topic .

"Oh? What conditions?" responded the curious Tabitha as she was cutting the omelet into smaller pieces for Lilia .

"He's not going to become an adventurer until after his birthday, which is in three months . We also decided on having a guard with him on his missions . Besides that, I feel like he'll be smart enough to manage the rest on his own . Of course, the last condition is that he'll be visiting as often as possible," my father explained, working on the rest of his roast beef .

"Do you have anyone in mind for who his guard is going to be? Heck, is there even a guard that is capable of guarding him? I feel like Arthur would be the one protecting the guard!" He just chuckled at the ridiculousness of an eight year old protecting a grown, veteran adventurer .

My mother answered him, looking at my father, "We haven't really thought of a person that fits the criteria . Rey and I thought we could use one of the Helstea Auction guards, but we couldn't really come up with anyone . "

"Can I have more omelet please?" My sister chimed in with her fork raised in the air .

"I got it!" My father stood up from his sudden revelation, making me almost choke on the piece of meat that was in my mouth .

"The Twin Horns will be coming back from an expedition in a dungeon soon . I received a letter from the Adventurer Guild Hall that says they should be back within two months! It's perfect! Why did it take so long for me to think of this? We can just have one of the Twin Horns to look after you . Arthur! You still remember them right?" My father's eyes shined in excitement .

"Hey! That's not a bad idea!" My mother said from the kitchen, her voice implying the rarity in my father having a good idea .

Handing a piece of meat to Sylvie who was perched on my lap with her front two paws on the table, I responded too . "Of course I remember them . That sounds like a great idea Dad . Do they know I'm back?"

"No, unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to send a mail to them yet . I was planning on doing that today . " My father sat back down, scratching his head .

Vincent chimed in on the conversation after finishing off his breakfast .

"Arthur, you said to Director Cynthia yesterday about not showing your powers to anyone until you enroll into Xyrus Academy, right? How were you planning on doing that while you're an Adventurer?"

"Ah yes . I've been meaning to get to that," I said while picking up a strawberry with my fork . "I planned on keeping my identity hidden as an adventurer . I've read that there were many members of the Adventurer's Guild that went by aliases, not revealing their identities to the public . " Unfortunately, since there was no way of masking the appearance of Sylvie, I would just have to do a good job of hiding her . Thankfully, she was small enough to fit inside a cloak if the pocket was big enough .

"Mmm… I see . " Both Vincent and Tabitha nodded at this .

With that, breakfast ended and we all separated .

Father went to the Guild Hall to send a letter to his old party members while my mother and Tabitha went shopping, taking Ellie and Lilia along with them . They asked me to come as well but I politely declined the offer to endure the suffering they call a pastime event . I washed up and headed towards the right wing of the manor, where Vincent's office was .

*Knock* *Knock*

"Yes?"

"It's Arthur," I answered .

The door opened to reveal Vincent with a curious look on his face . "Ah come in! What brings you here Arthur? You've never really come into my office before . "

"Ah yes . There is a certain matter I wish to talk to you about today, which is why I visited," I said while looking around at the piles of documents on the floor and on his desk .

VINCENT HELSTEA'S POV:

Was this child really only eight years old?

Shivers ran down my spine at the tone of his voice . Why was I so nervous at the mention of a 'certain matter' he wanted to talk to me about?

"What sort of matter is it?" I just asked, my face turning a bit more serious .

"I would like your help in obtaining a few items that might be hard to find elsewhere . " Continuing, he sat down and said with his eyes looking straight at me . "I need a sturdy hooded cloak or robe and a mask that can cover my entire face . It's imperative that the mask has the function of changing my voice . "

It wasn't hard to figure out why he wanted these items . As the owner of the Helstea Auction House that attracted even the highest of nobles and even the Royal Family, it shouldn't be too hard to get these items . The mask might be a little tricky because a sound elemental artificer would need to be the one to make this but it could be done .

Yet… why is there such a heavy feeling in this room?

I couldn't quite place my finger on it…

That's it!

Why was this eight-year-old child giving off the same pressure as the time I was next to the King of Sapin himself?

No . The atmosphere now was even heavier than when I was with the king .

He was clearly asking me for a favor . But it felt as though he is gauging me, almost as if he was trying to evaluate where to put me on his list of 'people to keep alive' .

I had never felt this from him, but that was probably because I had only ever seen him with his family .

I quickly replied, wanting to get it over with . "Sure, it shouldn't be a problem getting those things . The mask might take a bit of time but I'm sure we'll have it before you become an Adventurer . "

His slight nod actually filled me with relief . I had nobles that waited in line to introduce themselves to me but this kid…

"Is there anything you would need my help in for in exchange? I would feel bad just asking for this without any compensation . " He responded .

I felt a little sweat forming above my brows . "I-it's fine really . I owe your father a lot, actually . He may be working for me but the way he trains my guards have really lessened the number of problems that happen during the auctions . "

This was the truth actually . Rey had become an irreplaceable part of the Helstea Auction Houses . His leadership and charisma amongst the guards he trains is first class . I owed him when he saved my life and I owe him and his family now . Even with the generous salary that is well above the average and letting his family stay in our house, I still felt that it was actually a bargain on my part . Both Tabitha and Lilia have been happier now than ever after Rey moved in with Alice and had Ellie . I had always been filled with guilt for not being able to spend as much time with my family as they wanted but things were a lot better now .

"Hmm, speaking of training, that actually gives me an idea," He muttered while looking down .

I've noticed quite a while ago that, when Arthur started thinking, he had this look… this look where his gaze focused afar and his brows furrowed; the subtle crease near his lips and the slight twitch of his nose made him appear to be thinking of something above what normal human intelligence would be capable of . It was the look of a true intellectual . Sigh . It's hard to believe that he was the same age as my little Lilia .

"Allow me to start training your daughter to become a mage . " He put down this landmine as if he was just talking about the weather .

ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:

"I had been meaning to start teaching my baby sister in mana manipulation soon . It wouldn't be too much trouble to include Lilia in these lessons . I noticed that both you and Lady Tabitha are not mages so it might be impossible for her to awaken by herself, but if we start now, I think she'd be able to awaken around the average age," I said .

My statement was met with silence . I looked up to see Vincent drop the stack of papers had been fumbling with nervously . His face was frozen in place as I could hear his heart beating faster .

"C-can I truly believe what you just said? Can you really allow my daughter to become a m-mage?" He asked after a seemingly long moment of silence .

"Sure . It'll be a long process but it's definitely possible . Er… I will have to ask you to keep the lessons on a low profile though . I would hate to be bombarded with doting parents asking to make their children into mages," I just chuckled, trying to lighten up the tension .

He nodded furiously after failing to form a coherent sentence . .

"Sincerely… there would be no greater happiness than seeing my daughter become a mage," he managed to stammer out, tears on the verge falling down .

"Great! Then I'll leave the items we discussed to you! Now, allow me to excuse myself out . Sorry for intruding in on your work . "

I walked myself out of the room, picking up the sleeping Sylvie from my lap .

I'm glad that worked out well .



LILIA HELSTEA'S POV:

I'm shopping with Mommy and Lady Alice and Ellie . Ellie seemed a little bit disappointed that her brother didn't want to join us so I was holding her hand to comfort her .

"Hey Ellie . Do you like your big brother that much?"

"En! But he's a meanie for not shopping with us . I wanted to dress him up more," she pouted .

"Do you like me better or your big brother?"

After some time of thinking she just responded, "Umm…I like both!"

"Kukuku . Lilia, what are you asking Ellie?" My mom asked, pulling my other hand . "Lilia, what do you think of Arthur?"

"Uuu he's a little scary . How is he so strong, Mommy? I thought kids like us couldn't be mages until we're all grown up?" It wasn't fair . I've always dreamt of becoming a mage and making Mommy and Papa happy .

My mom looked at Lady Alice, "I guess it's because he's a very gifted child . But Alice, do you really have no problems with everything he told you? I don't mean to butt in on your parenting but doesn't it just seem a little too weird? How did he get so powerful during this time? You've told me that he was pretty good at fighting even before the bandit attack . "

I saw Lady Alice shake her head . "Of course I know he's hiding a lot of things . He probably doesn't know but it's pretty obvious when he's lying . He tends to focus his gaze on one point and his voice turns monotone when he lies . It's pretty cute how he thinks he's being sneaky actually . 'Sigh', Tabitha, I know he's keeping things from us and so does Rey, but we agreed on giving him some space until he's comfortable enough to tell us himself . I guess that's just what it means to be a parent . I know he doesn't mean any harm so all we can do is just support him until he's ready . "

"Lying is bad!" Little Ellie declared .

I agreed with her on that . "Yeah Ellie! Lying is bad!"

ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:

I start concentrating on my mana core, distracted by a series of unexplainable sneezes . I was getting too impatient with my training . I wanted to hurry up and get to the previous level in my past life but that wasn't happening as fast as I wanted it to .

The little fight with Director Goodsky made it all too real for me . I was too inexperienced and weak . It didn't really affect me until now, but I'm wasn't used to fighting the way mages fought in this world . The fact that there was nothing like conjurers in my previous world made fighting one a lot more difficult . My concentration wavered while my mind flashed back to my past life . The scene on that foggy night when the orphanage's head caretaker, the closest thing to a mother figure I had, was shot . I was still young at that time, but if I think back now, that was probably the reason I had started training like a madman . Head Mother was the one that picked me off the streets, giving me a steamed bun . After that, she took care of me, taught me how to read and write, scolded me and taught me basic manners .

I didn't want to become a king; I just wanted vengeance . I just wanted to be strong enough to kill the ones responsible for the death of the person who had taken care of me… who had loved me . It was never as simple as that, though . It had turned out that the ones responsible for killing the orphanage head caretaker, along with other leader figures of the various orphanages, were the military from another country .

I realized then that no matter how powerful an individual was he was still just one person . I needed authority along with my power . Becoming a king then served its purpose . The first thing I did when I was appointed King was destroy that country . I bloodied my hands with the corpses of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and millions all together . The cruel thing, though, was that no matter what kind of revenge is taken, it didn't change what had happened to her . She still had died an unjust death .

This life was going to be different . I wasn't going to let the ones I treasured suffer .

Sylvie nudged her wet nose at me, a concerned gaze fixed on my eyes . 'I'm here, feel better' was what she seemed to say to me .

Petting her head, I stirred myself out of my unpleasant memories .

I washed myself off, laughing at the crying Sylvie who still hated getting wet . I was glad I had her by my side . It wasn't healthy for me to be alone thinking by myself for too long .

Just on time, the girls got back from their shopping trip by the time I had finished dressing up . I hopped down the stairs to greet them .

"Hmph! Brother is a meanie!" My sister just puckered her lower lip with her arms crossed .

"Is it because I didn't go shopping with you, Ellie? I'm sorry . " I patted her turned head, which made her tense her face as she forced herself to keep from smiling .

"How was shopping Mom, Lady Tabitha? Did you guys buy a lot of stuff?" I asked, my hand still on my sister's head .

"We didn't buy much, just a couple of new outfits for Ellie and Lilia," my mother responded .

At this time, I heard a storm of footsteps coming toward us . Vincent arrived beide us with an excited look on his face . His eyes were a little red and he had an uncontainable smile on his face .

"You guys are finally here!" He said picking up his daughter and kissing her cheek .

"Honey, why are you so flustered? Have you been crying? "What is going on?" Tabitha had a bewildered look on her face from confusion and worry . Vince did look a little crazy right now . "You didn't tell them yet, Arthur?" He faced me, the goofy smile still pasted on his face .

Shaking my head, I chuckled, "I just got down as well . I was about to tell them . "

"Tell us what, baby?" My mother had a look of concern as well . Mothers never liked not knowing what was going on .

"I discussed with Mr . Vincent about teaching Ellie and Lilia mana manipulation starting today . Of course, only if Lady Tabitha was okay with it . "

"…"

Tabitha just shook her head, looking at her husband . "W-wait, hold on . Is this some sort of prank? If it is, it's not funny . "

"No ma'am . I know both you and Sir Vincent aren't mages but it is possible for Lilia to become one . " I gave her a sincere look .

"N-no way . I've never heard of a method for teaching someone mana manipulation . I've been taught that it's up to the child's innate talent to awaken by herself . Why haven't I heard anyone else teaching kids then?"

Tabitha had a lot harder time believing that Lilia could become a mage than her husband . I didn't blame her though . Vincent didn't even question me, which was surprising . The biggest worry for a mother from a noble family was the future of her children and in a society where mages are the elites, the Helstea's lineage, no matter how rich they were, would get more than a few looks of pity .

"I've never heard of anything like teaching a child mana manipulation either, Art . How do you plan on doing this?" my mother quizzed .

"Mom, you guys all know how I awakened at the age of 3 right? I still remember what happened and why it did . I'm going to do what I did on myself to them . I'll have to test them before I can even start but for Ellie, I'm 100% sure she'll be able awaken and for Lilia, around 70%," I answered . The probability was higher than what I said for Lilia but I didn't want to get their hopes up too much . There was still a chance she wouldn't be able to awaken .

"Heavens . T-this is . Give me a minute . I need to sit down . " I noticed Tabitha's knees were wobbling as she made her way to the couch .

"This isn't going to be an instant thing . It'll take a few years for them to awaken on their own after I teach them . "

The Helstea parents just nodded at this and I turned to face the confused Lilia and Ellie .

"Ellie, Lilia, can you guys sit down on the floor over by the fireplace?" I instructed, guiding them into the living room . "I want you guys to sit in your most comfortable position, back to back . Leave some space so I can sit in between . "Ellie was still a little clueless as to what was going on, but Lilia had gotten the gist of what was happening and I could see the determined look on her face . Ellie sat down with her legs stuck out in front of her while Lilia sat in a more ladylike position with both her legs tucked in to her left side .

"Okay . Before I do anything, I want you guys to close your eyes and concentrate . If you try really hard, you'll be able see some spots of light . Do you see it?" I placed myself between them now as Tabitha, Vincent, and my mother were all staring intently .

"…"

"N-no… I don't really see anything," I heard a murmur from Lilia . I expected much but I turned to see everyone having looks of panic on them . Ignoring them, I turned to face my sister and asked her the same thing . I was less afraid of her seeing the light, but not recognizing what to actually spot .

Thankfully, she responded, "Bruhder, I think I see a small pretty light!"

The next step involved doing something that only I was capable of doing . I had to will mana of all four elemental attributes at once into their bodies . Doing this, they would be able to see a lot more clearly the specks of mana that were scattered in their body .

"Okay I'm going to start now . You guys will feel a little feverish but I want you guys to endure it and just focus on the specks of light . " As soon as I said that, I willed my quadra elemental mana into them .

The reason that all four elements had to be exerted unto them was because the mana that had yet to gather and form a mana core was at its purest form, meaning that all four elements needed to be exerted at the same power into their bodies to trigger any sort of responses from the dormant mana inside them .

"Eep!" "Hng!" Lilia and Ellie yelped out a little in surprise .

"I-I think I see some of the lights! They're so pretty!" exclaimed Lilia .

"Wow! So many!" Echoed my little sister .

"Okay, this part is important, I'm going to help you guys with this part but your job is to try and connect all of the little lights okay? Do you get that Ellie? Pretend that all of the little lights are friends and they need to meet together . Can you do that for me, Ellie?" This was the trickiest and longest part and I had to make sure that they understood what to do .

"O-okay! I think I get it!" "The lights are friends? Okay!"

I remained in my position for over an hour to trigger the dormant mana in their body, at least to the point that they would be visible enough for them to manipulate and gather .

Taking a deep breath, I removed my hands from their back, instructing them to continue gathering the little lights until the lights disappear .

"How is it? D-do you think Lilia will be able to become a mage?" Both the Helstea parents are a mess . They had anxious looks on their faces while Vincent was nervously chewing on a fingernail . I looked at my mother and even she had a hint of uneasiness in her eyes .

I responded with a wide smile . "Don't worry, both Lilia and my little sister should awaken as a mage within a few years . My plan was to do this with them every day for the few months that I'll be home . By then, they should be capable of training on their own to form a mana cor…"

Tabitha didn't even let me finish as picked me up into a big hug . "Oh thank you thank you thank you . My baby will be able to learn magic! Oh my goodness I was so worried what her future would be since both of us aren't mages . *Sniff* Uuu… thank you so much, Arthur . "

Vincent's face was streaming tears as he kept his gaze on his daughter meditating . My mother patted my head silently, giving me a proud smile .

It wasn't as big of a deal for Ellie to become a mage since our whole family could use magic . The chances of her never awakening would have been slim to none even if I didn't do anything; I was just speeding up the process . I had figured the faster she learns magic, the faster she would be able to protect herself .

The two girls lasted a couple of hours before the mana I exerted dispersed out of their body . Surprisingly, Lilia actually lasted longer than Ellie . She definitely had more willpower than my four-year-old sister .

My father came a bit after from the Guild Hall and was ecstatic for the Helstea family that they were going to have their first mage in the family .

Picking up Eleanor and rubbing his beard on her cheek, my father just cooed, "Aww, my little baby is going to be strong like her older brother! Promise me you won't be stronger than father, okay? Or he'll be very sad . "

My mother just laughed at this while my sister just giggled, pushing Father's face away . "Papa! Your beard tickles! St~op, hehe!"

We had a great dinner party that night . Vincent and Tabitha went all out on the delicacies leaving my mouth watering and Sylv drooling right next to me . We ended the night with everyone merry, Vincent going around offering drinks to even the maids and butlers .

The following days had consisted of condensing my mana core and my elemental skills along with my dragon will's powers . This was a mind-numbingly slow process and I felt myself stagnating because of the lack of stimulation .

I spent a few days out of the week sparring with Father but I could tell he was afraid of hurting me, always holding back even when it was unnecessary .

Besides my training, I spent a couple of hours everyday watching over my sister and Lilia while they continued their journey to form their cores . It was a strenuous process and I could see my sister being a bit more impatient with the training but I did my best to help her through it by making games out of it .

During this time, I got to talk to my mother about her abilities as an Emitter . I asked how she was able to learn it and train it when there were so few Emitters and she smiled at me mysteriously, saying how a woman needed to have a few secrets of her own .

I guess I would have to ask her again when she was feeling less secretive .

Two weeks before my birthday and the start of my career as an Adventurer, I was startled by loud, obnoxious knocks on the front door . Opening the door, the faces of the all too familiar group made my lips curl up .

As I absentmindedly took a sip from my cup of coffee, a scalding sensation startled me out of my daze . Vince and I were seated around the small table on the outside patio as we discussed some business plans on the Helstea Auction House . The topic had shifted towards the security parameters and how we were currently approaching the stages where it was necessary to completely restructure and enhance the guard teams .

Alongside capable nonmage adventurers, we had recently managed to recruit a few long range augmenters, making up an extremely powerful addition to the security . While it was still widely prevalent for augmenters to go the melee route due to functionality and ease, ranged augmenters, like archers and crossbowmen, continued to be a much more powerful asset in defensive settings . Vince poked at me a few times whether conjurers should be employed for the upcoming event .

"Hmmm…I know how beneficial it'd be to have conjurers that could set up barriers and help support the augmenters, but I'm against it . " I took another, more careful sip from my cup .

"You mind elaborating? You just said how helpful it'd be to have them," he rebutted as he rhythmically stirred his tea .

Setting down my cup, I replied, "If we're just talking about firepower, I'd be all for it, but you know it's not as simple as that, Vince . It would affect team morale having even a few conjurers in a team of augmenters . You know yourself how snobby most conjurers can get . I swear they think they're angel incarnates; most of them think of augmenters as some sort of primitive beasts for using their hands to fight . Even if we do manage to find a few that aren't so rotten, the team would start thinking we're hiring conjurers because I don't trust them . "

Vince's gaze was focused blankly on a stained smudge on the table; it was obvious what he was thinking . "You have a point . I left you completely in charge of the security aspects, so we'll go with what you say, but we need to be absolutely sure the 10th Anniversary Helstea Auction goes well . Even the Royal Family will be there this time . We can't let any commotions get too big . "

I simply nodded in agreement, giving my friend an appreciative smile .

"Oh right! We need to take your son with us to the Tenth Anniversary Auction . He had mentioned he wanted a sword, right? I didn't know you had taught him how to use the sword . I expected the boy to take after you on the infighting style you're so good at with your gauntlets . "

"Sigh . I never taught him how to use the sword, Vince . He's already had a grasp of sword fighting since he was four years old," I let out, disbelieving the words that came out of my own mouth .

"You can't be serious… Lilia was still scared to go down the stairs by herself when she was four," a bewildered Vince sputtered .

I continued, "He apparently learned by watching me train and reading books on swords . Vince, that's not even the part I care about . It's when we spar, though . His gaze when we practice, his reactions and fighting style . I don't feel like I'm sparring with my eight-year-old son . It feels like I'm fighting some veteran sword master . The only reason I can handle him right now is because his body is still immature, but the way he reacts to my moves…it's something that only comes with decades of experience in life-or-death fighting . "

"Mmm…I can't say I don't know what you're talking about . I sometimes find myself wondering if your son is actually only eight . Are you scared of him, Rey?" he asked seriously .

"No . That's one thing I've become more and more sure of . No matter what, he's still my son . I know he cares deeply about his family, too and that's all I could ask for as his father . "

ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:

During these past two months, it was evident that there had been progress in Lilia's and my sister's mana manipulation . It was no longer necessary to infuse my mana into them anymore, so they were able to train by themselves now . Of course, it would still take a few years for them to form a mana core—especially Ellie and her short attention span—but I did drill into the both of them the importance of keeping their training a secret .

I didn't need to remind my parents and the Helstea family that keeping this a secret was important, but it was blatantly obvious that the four of them were excited for the day Lilia and Ellie would awaken .

Sylvie had been sleeping much more these past two months, but there were changes that became noticeable . For one, her intelligence was rapidly increasing . Her thoughts to me were more intricate and contained complicated emotions that went past just 'hungry' or 'sleepy . ' In the few short months after she was born, it felt like she had gained years of emotional intelligence .

One major change had happened recently; she learned how to transform . Okay, it wasn't really something as drastic as transformation, but she was able to manipulate her body a little . It felt like it happened so suddenly . I had been pondering how to hide her appearance in the days to come when she grows larger . She had been beside me when she started whining and scratching herself as if uncomfortable . The next thing I knew, her red spikes began retracting while her horns got smaller . It was a mind-blowing surprise . Now, most of the time, Sylvie just kept her spikes and horns retracted, making her look more like a cute, black scaled fox with little horns .

Throughout this time, both Vincent and Tabitha had insisted on giving me more gifts as thanks . Even if I wasn't able to acquire the cloak or mask, I had been planning on training Lilia . After all, she's part of the family that helped my family, so as far as I was concerned, there was nothing to lose in helping them . After numerous refusals, we had finally settled on something they could get me: a sword .

My body had finally grown big enough to properly handle a small sword without awkwardly toppling over at the slightest mishap . It wouldn't be bigger than an adult-sized dagger, but it finally allowed me to train my swordsmanship with something other than a wooden stick . We had decided to make it a family event and have both my family and Vincent's family go visit the Tenth Anniversary Helstea Auction .

Waiting in the living room downstairs for my father and Vince to get ready, I heard an obnoxious knock from the front door .

Sheesh, knocking once is plenty .

I let out a slightly annoyed shout that I'd get it since I was close by, anyway . No need to trouble the maids when I was right next to door .

"Who's ther—OOF!"

I was hit with the nostalgic sensation of getting smothered by a pair of foam pillows . A classic way of assassination, but shouldn't it be used while I'm sleeping?

"Oh my goodness! You were alive! Look how big you've gotten! I'm so sorry, Art! I wasn't able to protect you! I'm so glad!" the lady sniffled .

"Mmfph! Mmmfph!"

"Angela, I don't think he can breathe…" A comforting voice pointed out .

"Eep! S-Sorry!" Angela squealed .

Peeling my face away, I smiled at the sight of my companions . "It's so good seeing you guys again!"

My giant guardian angel, Durden, patted my head and I saw his narrow eyes getting watery, triggering a tear from me as well .

Adam smacked me on the butt . "Little brat! You know how devastated everyone was because of what happened? It's good to see you again, hehe . "

"You've gotten better-looking, Arthur . " I turned to see the charismatic Helen Shard with her signature bow still strapped to her back squat down in front of me . She lightly pinched my cheek and gave me a sympathetic smile before standing back up .

Suddenly, I'm embraced again, but this time, I was thoroughly surprised . "Sniff . "

It was Jasmine . That cold, aloof Jasmine . She kept mute as she just tightened her arms around me, letting out soft sniffles .

I couldn't resist the urge to pet her head when she suddenly peeled herself away from me, her face scarlet . Quickly standing up and trying to regain composure, she shot me an embarrassed nod and turned away .

At this time, Sylvie woke up from her nap on the couch and trotted towards us . "Woah! What is that?" Adam exclaimed . The rest of the Twin Horns had the same expression of surprise as even Jasmine turned back to look at the mysterious mana beast .

"She's my contracted beast, Sylvie," I announced while my bond hopped on top of my head .

"Holy crap! You already have a contracted beast? Do you know how valuable it is to have a bond? Oh man, I've been trying to look for a beast to tame these past few years but with no luck . The ones that they sell are way too expensive, too, lucky brat!" Adam was practically pulling his hair out in jealousy .

"Bonds," or "contracted beasts" for the official term, were highly sought after by both types of mages . It was a bit more advantageous for conjurers since, while the master prepared spells, the bond would be able to protect them . However, it was also very useful for augmenters as well, who often sought after beasts to contract them as mounts or a partner to have their back .

"What's with all the commotion down…Ah! You guys are here!" My father, wearing his uniform, leaped down the flight of stairs and rushed toward his ex-party members .

He was giving all of them a hug as my mother and sister came down soon after .

"Everyone! It's so good seeing you guys again!" my mother exclaimed . She didn't have the chance to say anything more as the girls all threw themselves at her and start drooling over my baby sister, both of whom were dressed very nicely for the event . My parents hadn't seen the Twin Horns for almost as long as me, so everyone was just as excited .

"Oh my goodness! Alice, Ellie looks just like you! She's going to grow up to be so pretty!"

"…Cute . "

"Rey is going to have his hands full soon with potential candidates kukuku . Can you tell me how old you are?"

"Four!"

The girls were a jumble of excitement and estrogen as they ogled Ellie .

Vincent came down soon after with Tabitha and Lilia . The mother and father duo were matching in a black suit and dress while Lilia was sporting a flowery dress under a warm cloak . After everyone introduced each other, it was decided that the Twin Horns would come with us to the Helstea Auction House for the Tenth Anniversary event . On the way there, I filled them in on what had happened after the fall . My dad explained to them the basics in his letter, but they were dying to know the details . They were quite shocked when they learned I was in the Kingdom of Elenoir for over four years .

The ride was pretty short, so I wasn't able to finish telling them everything before we got off .

The first thought that had come to mind upon arrival was that Vincent really put in a lot of work into this . The Helstea Auction House was breathtaking . It was rather misleading to even call it a house as it towered high above any of the other buildings nearby . I've been to many national and historical monuments that were created by the most famous architects, but this was on a different level . I suspected that they had a lot of help from Conjurers from how large it was . The Auction House was a magnificent theatre with intricate designs all over . The main doors were over 4 meters in height and were made from petrified wood with carved designs on it . Compared to the naturalistic and elegant designs that I saw in the Elf Kingdom, this was more complicated and grand . It was in the shape of a half-cylinder with detailed stone sculptures of different weapons as supports .

We arrived early, so only the workers and guards were present, preparing for the event . The inside was equally, if not more stunning . The front door opened to a path that stretched out to a stage on the other end . To our left and right, there were rows of escalating seats made from a rather luxurious burgundy leather that could fit over ten thousand people comfortably . Upon looking up, I noticed that there were incased booths at the very top of the rows of seats and even higher, there was a single room attached to the ceiling and back wall with glass surrounding it, giving a clear view of the stage . It was easy to guess that those booths, as well as the single room, was for the VIP .

Turns out, that VIP room on the ceiling was the room we'd be seated in . Father and the Twin Horns, who had decided to help my father and the guards to prepare for any unwanted commotions or outbreaks, were the first to separate from us . Vincent separated from us after as he barked out orders at the workers and readied the hosts to greet the more important guests .

Tabitha led us to the room, making us comfortable inside the carefully-designed and furnished area that was meant for only the most distinguished and wealthy guests . There was a wine rack and a few reclining seats and tables with closer seats by the window . I made myself comfortable on a seat closest to the window .

The auction house was soon a panorama of cheerful and excited noise, as more and more people, who were no doubt people of some sort of influence, began filling the lower seats . There were some groups that seemed more distinguished than the rest who were personally escorted by the hosts to their booths . No doubt, they were some of the more affluent nobles in the Kingdom . Growing bored of the hordes of overdressed nobles chatting eagerly amongst themselves, I shifted my attention to Lilia as she was teaching some sort of clapping game to Ellie . I couldn't help but smile myself as the both of them broke into a fit of giggles when either of them messed up and were flicked gently in the ear as punishment .

Time passed by rather slowly until Vincent came back, leading a group of unfamiliar people inside .

The first to come in behind Vincent was an elderly man with long, deep-red hair that was aged with streaks of grey . His back was ramrod straight with broad shoulders that took off years in his appearance . The man's eyes were stern with harsh, sword-shaped eyebrows, giving him an undeniably eye-catching presence . He was wearing a red robe lined with white fur around the collar and had a cane that shined brighter than any silver I had previously seen . Trailing closely behind him was a lady that looked a few years older than my mother . While my mother had a lovely, sweet, friendly ambience, this lady's facial features reminded me of an ice sculpture; refined, elegant, noble and of no flaws, but also cold and devoid of emotion . She was wearing a shimmering silvery-white dress that complimented her dark blue hair that draped over her shoulders like a well-kept tapestry .

Behind the lady of whom I assumed was the man's wife were two younger kids that could only be their kin . The older child, a boy that looked to be about the age of thirteen or so, took more after his father . With his serious brown eyes, straight brows, and his short mahogany hair that had a shiny luster just like his father's, it was apparent as to what he would look like a few decades down the road . Despite his fierce looks, however, there was a sort of unrefined charisma that was different from his father's . It was the sort of charisma that would make him the center of any group .

The younger one, a girl that looked to be about my age, surveyed the room carefully before locking eyes with me .

It would still be a couple of years until she started maturing, but needless to say, the potential was there . I couldn't help comparing her to Tess . They would both grow to be captivating to the men around them, but in very different ways . Tess was the lovely girl next door, with her comforting almond-shaped eyes that glowed a bright teal . Her peaches and cream complexion and rosy cheeks . Her unique, gunmetal hair complimented her eyes, giving her a mysterious, yet approachable aura .

No, this girl was the complete opposite . Her porcelain white complexion was a canvas for her meticulously carved facial features . Her penetratingly sharp eyes that seemed much too mature for her age was a dark brown shade that appeared larger because of her long, thick lashes . Her hair was a glaring black, which she got from her mother . Compared to her dark hair and eyes, however, her small lips were covered in a soft pink shade that gave life to her doll-like appearance .

It was hard not to wonder how they would grow up to be; whether mother nature would make them bloom or wither .

Peeling my eyes off of the girl in front of me, I focused on the three guards that followed after the picturesque family .

"I didn't know we would be in here with guests, Vincent," the man said, neither harshly nor kindly .

"I apologize, Your Majesty! I assumed you wouldn't mind having a few other people with you . You remember my wife, Tabitha, right? Well, these are our close family friends," he introduced, waving his arm in our direction .

After regarding us for a moment, his lips curled up into a smile . "If they are your friends, Vincent, then they are mine as well . "

"It's a pleasure to meet you . At least we'll have some company besides these guards," the lady giggled .

I raised an eyebrow in surprise at the sharp contrast in the woman's personality to her appearance . She seemed much more welcoming, despite her intimidating looks, than her husband .

"Everyone, as you all may know, I'd like you all to meet the King and Queen of Sapin . Introduce yourselves to King Blaine Glayder and Queen Priscilla Glayder and their children, Curtis and Kathyln . "

At this, my mother—who was holding my sister—Tabitha, and even Lilia, dropped down, genuflecting . I caught on and lowered myself a moment later as well .

Giving us a nod, the King gestured for us to stand . "No more of this, now . No need to be stiff, we're just here for the auction, after all . "

As I got back up, Sylvie peeked her head out from under my robe where she was sleeping, surveying curiously the new faces .

"Kuu?" she chirped, tilting her head .

I thought I heard a gasp from one of the guards in the rear, but I wasn't able to tell since their faces were covered .

"Oh my! What a cute little mana beast!" Queen Priscilla's face brightened up at the sight as she made her way towards me .

The King and the two children's eyes looked towards my direction as well .

The guards took a step forward as well, making sure they were close enough to react in case something happened to the Queen .

"She just hatched a few months ago . Her name is Sylvie . Come out and say hello," I responded .

"Kyu~!" she cooed while hopping out of my robe and stretching her body like a cat .

"I assume this little mana beast is your bond, young man?" The King came closer, kneeling down to get a closer view of Sylvie .

I just gave a wordless nod . It should be fine with Sylv's appearance the way it is . "How fortunate you are to have a mana beast . Even infant ones are not easy to tame, yet she looks to be very obedient . "

"Well we're able to communicate mentally, so it's more like a mutual agreement rather than obedience," I simply shrugged .

"What? You mean to say that you are under an Equals Contract?"

We all turned our heads to face the source of the voice . It was one of the hooded guards behind the children .

Damn, did I say something I wasn't supposed to?

"Umm, I'm not sure what that is, but she was the one that initiated the contract, so I think so?" I shrugged, hoping to switch topic .

Was it that big of a deal who formed the contract?

"Let me take a closer look at your bond!" the hooded guard exclaimed, creeping closer to us .

Before I could decline, the King stepped in .

"This isn't the time nor place to study someone else's pet . You're being rude, Sebastian . " His gaze turned harsh as he rebuked him .

"My apologies…" he said, hoping I'd complete the sentence .

"Arthur . Arthur Leywin," I finished, giving a curt bow . As he and his wife gave me a small smile, we took our seats in time to hear the clear voice declaring that the auction would start soon .

A cold shiver made me turn back just to see Sebastian, who had taken off his hood, staring intently at Sylvie, who was nestled on my lap .



"Ladies and Gentlemen! May I say that it is of the highest honor for me to be here tonight? All of you are gathered here today for one reason and one reason only, I presume? It is to have the chance to obtain rare and valuable items in this auction!"

Applause thundered in enthusiasm at the old gentleman's ardent introduction .

"If everyone in the audience would now kindly turn to face the back room at the very top, we have a few exceedingly important figures that have decided to bless us with their presence . Please join me in welcoming the King and Queen of Sapin!" The auctioneer was the first to flick out the tail of his suit and genuflect . The audience immediately followed suit, lowering themselves respectfully in a bow since they couldn't kneel in their seats .

The King and Queen, in response, stepped out towards the window in front of me and waved their arms slowly in a practiced motion .

"Next, the one that made this whole event possible . Please give a big round of applause for Vincent Helstea!"

The auctioneer's introduction was followed by another round of applause as Vincent stepped up next to the King and Queen, giving a deep bow in return .

I remained seated, looking down below at the crowds of people who were supposed to be of much higher class than me, but I couldn't help but look at them as if they were…

No… I shouldn't think like that . I'm not a king anymore . Hell, I haven't even gone through puberty yet . No point in acting like someone who didn't exist anymore .

I turned my gaze toward the King and Queen, studying them . Despite the stoic expression the King always carried, he didn't have a domineering demeanor . He had a charismatic and strong presence, making it easy to believe that a majority of the citizens of Sapin would respect him, but that was it . He didn't earn his seat; his father had given it to him . The Glayder family had been the Royal Family since the founding of Sapin . I wasn't surprised to see that King Glayder's mana core was only at the red stage .

Turning my gaze over to the Queen, something caught my eyes that I didn't really notice at first . Strapped to the backside of her dress was a white wand . I couldn't sense her mana, which meant she was either carrying an artifact that could hide it or she was at a level high enough where I couldn't sense it .

Queen Priscilla caught me observing her and gave me a discerning smile, revealing her pearl white teeth . Her smile threw me off-guard, making me flinch and quickly turn away . I could feel how hot my face was, making it all the more embarrassing . The word beautiful wouldn't do justice as a means of describing her . However, one thing I had noticed ever since coming to this world was the fact that I lacked any sort of sexual attraction towards these older women . At first, I had thought that it might've been due of the lack of necessary hormones currently in this prepubescent body, but the more I thought about it, I felt like it boiled down to the fact that my mother was just a bit younger than I had been before being reborn into this world .

I had never really been interested in human psychology but it was interesting noticing that women associated with the same age group as my parental guardian made them unappealing sexually . Maybe that was just me; no way to tell .

Of course, that also didn't mean I'd go for children my age like Tess, Lilia, or even this ice princess here . They could be the very personification of beauty itself, but it didn't change the fact that their mental level was that of a child . This was the reason I wasn't able to see Tess as anything other than a friend or a sister to me, even when she was so obvious in showing her attraction towards me . Maybe when she's older and more mature, I would start thinking about it .

Sigh . Being popular sure was a hassle .

"…kuu . " I looked down to see Sylvie staring at me cynically, her eye half-open, judging eye seeming to say 'are you serious?'

"Haha…" I couldn't help but laugh in embarrassment as I pushed Sylvie's face in a different direction to redirect her hurtful stare with my hands to block her hurtful gaze .

A large hand lightly squeezed my shoulder . "Arthur, a sword is up for auction right now . Tell me if you want it so I can put in my bid . Don't worry about the price either! Perks of being the owner of this place," Vincent whispered .

"Thank you . " I turned my attention to the item being auctioned off .

"This short sword was forged by a master smith who is also a fire artificer, ensuring that the quality during the forging process is top class . The core of this weapon is made from the core of a Thunder Hawk mana beast . Reinforcing this sword with just a little mana will produce currents of electricity around the edge of the blade, enhancing its cutting power and even having a mild paralyzing effect! The bid will start at fifty gold!"

Excited cries erupted immediately as nearly every noble boy who sought to become a mage tugged at their parent's sleeves, begging them to bid . I remained motionless, my head propped up on my arm as I inadvertently let out a yawn . There was a large screen that magnified the items so the audience in the back was able to see . However, while the little shock ability could be handy, it was obvious that the sword itself was subpar at best compared to the blade I had wielded in my previous life .

Vincent had been constantly shifting his gaze between me and the weapon, hoping I would at least be interested in the weapon that most people would kill over .

I shook my head in response .

"No worries! That was just the start! Let me know when you find something you like . Oh! I almost forgot . I have the items you wanted in the back . I'll have one of the workers deliver it to me after this event is over," he whispered, leaning closely to so only I could hear .

My ears perked up as I abruptly turned to him . "You managed to find a voice-altering mask as well?"

"It took a bit longer than I expected but I finally managed to find one . I also got you a coat made from a nightmare fox that should make it harder for the wearer to be registered to the unsuspecting eye . I thought it would be something you would want so I snatched that too while I could," Vincent replied softly, shooting me a wink .

"That's more than what I had hoped for . " The mask was essential for me to become an adventurer, but the coat would no doubt be useful as well .

"Don't worry about it and just stay safe . I'm the one that has to deal with your family if something happens to you, you know," he chuckled .

I just smiled wryly at this fact . No . I wasn't going to give my family a reason to grieve again like I had done to them before .

There were a few interesting items along the way . There were several beast cores, most of which were B-class or lower . The prices for those were astronomical . Even a C-class core was around fifty gold, and each class multiplied this figure exponentially . There were a few more artifacts and cores but none of those were things I wanted . The King himself bid on a few of them, winning an A-class beast core . It wasn't until a mage actually absorbed the core that they would find whether a beast core still contained a will or not . Chances were slim to find a core that still had its will still intact; even if it did contain the will, it had to be compatible with the user . Most beasts, however, had already passed it on to one of its offspring or instinctively chose to disperse their will before dying .

I guess the King was hoping to get lucky . The Queen, on the other hand, bid on a mana absorption ring and a couple other items useful for conjurers .

As we approached the latter half of the auction, the items began increasing in value . As more and more items were sold off, my interest started to deplete until a large, square container, covered by a sheet, was rolled out onto the stage by a few workers .

I couldn't help but grow agitated as the auctioneer removed the sheet, revealing a cage full of females chained together with only a dirty sack to cover their private areas .

It disgusted me as so many noblemen frantically began bidding on the young female slaves that were soon stripped to show their assets like animals . I realized that being born in a small town with people who disagreed with the idea of having slaves had made me almost forget the fact that slaves actually existed in this world .

My world abolished slavery hundreds of years ago, so the idea of owning a slave was something that I just couldn't get used to .

Memories of killing the slave traders that had abducted Tessia came back to mind . If I hadn't been there to rescue her, what would've happened? A shiver ran down my spine at the thought of Tessia being abused by a corrupt aristocrat . Now that I think about it, didn't I inadvertently prevent a war from happening between the humans and elves?

The taste of metal in my mouth brought me back to reality . Realizing that I had bit down too hard on my lower lip, I quickly wiped the blood off of my lips with my finger .

Tabitha and my mother had solemn faces at the sight of the slaves, but they simply shook their heads and focused their attention on Ellie and Lilia instead . Even though the Helstea family was a very prominent noble house, they opposed the idea of keeping slaves and opted to simply hire maids and butlers .

Vincent's face flashed with guilt but he quickly regained composure . I'm sure he was against this, but it couldn't be helped that the popularity and demand of slaves were too high .

Turning my head, I spotted the prince murmuring something to the little princess, but I couldn't guess what from her expressionless face .

This was becoming tedious . I was beginning to think that it would be better to hold off on getting a decent sword for now and just settle for a decent practice sword until my body matured a bit .

Getting up from my seat, I leaned back, stretching my stiff body when I spotted the hooded guard named Sebastian eyeing Sylvie with a disturbing twinkle in his eyes .

The beady-eyed, bony conjurer underneath that hood continued impatiently fiddling with his metal staff as his eyes stayed greedily fixated on my bond .

After a few moments, he noticed that I was glaring back at him . Letting out a stifled cough in response, he straightened his robe as he spread out his normally hunched shoulders to make himself look bigger . Staring down at me, he had the audacity to let out a smug grin, as if he had every right to do what he was going to do .

This foolish plebeian has the audacity to…

VINCENT HELSTEA'S POV:

It was a pity Arthur wasn't able to find a suitable sword .

No matter . There are enough swords in storage; I'm sure he will take a liking to at least one of them .

"Your Majesty, I hope you're finding it worthwhile to visit this humble auction house of ours," I assured, lowering myself .

"This place and event was anything but humble, Vincent . And yes, I'm not sure how you managed to secure an A-class beast core from a silvercoat bear, but you've managed to build quite the network . Let's just hope that the beast will is still intact . " He clasped my back excitedly with his hand .

"Don't get your hopes up too much, Dear . You know how rare it is," I could hear the Queen mutter quietly in response .

The Queen turned back to resume her conversation with Alice and my wife . They seemed to be discussing something about the kids .

His Majesty and I turned our attention back to the main stage when, all of a sudden, a terrifyingly oppressive presence filled the room, constricting my body .

I tried my hardest to move, to try and find the source of this domineering bloodlust, but my body refused to obey .

What the hell was going on? This was the most secure area in the entire building with the King's guard inside, as well as my own, securing the outside of the room .

My breathing turned shallow as the overbearing pressure continued gripping at my insides .

I could feel beads of cold sweat slowly rolling down my face as if they, too, were afraid .

With much effort, my body relented a little and I was able to turn my gaze slightly to see if they knew what was going on . While they were at least able to move their bodies, it was clear that they were just as confused as I was .

I had no idea what to expect next . I had assumed that I would live for quite a bit longer, yet here I was, at death's door, trying to struggle out of his icy grasp .

What in Hell's name was happening?

ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:

Damn it . I lost control .

I quickly turned away from the pale-faced Sebastian currently shaking on the floor, hoping no one had noticed .

I had only meant to give Sebastian a little scare, not to terrify every person in the room .

Taking a quick peek around, I let out a small sigh of relief after seeing that my mother and sister were okay . My sister was startled and crying, but they were both far away enough to not get directly affected .

I didn't think it would be this bad with this body of mine .

This was the first time letting my killing intent loose . Even when I was up against the slave traders, I had chosen not to emit any kind of intent in order to catch them by surprise .

The King's augmenter guards had their weapons unsheathed and positioned to defend around the royal family by the time I had withdrawn the pressure I had exerted onto the room .

"Who's there? You dare try and attack the royal family?" the King roared as he pushed his wife and children behind him . Queen Priscilla had her wand out and was silently muttering a spell as she herded her frightened children, as well as my mother and my sister, Ellie, behind her husband and the guards .

Vincent used an artifact in his hands to call for more guards inside and had the others scout the area for any assassins that may be, or had been, nearby .

Time ticked slowly for me as everyone in the room was in a state of panic and tension . My mother had grabbed me, holding firmly onto me and my sister as guards ran around with weapons held close .

My father had stopped by, but, after making sure that we were okay, left to try and search for the mysterious attacker .

It wasn't until they confirmed killing an intruder on the roof of the auction house that everyone had calmed down .

I let out sigh of relief, but unlike everyone else, my relief wasn't for the fact that the intruder had been killed, but the fact that I had been provided with a convenient scapegoat .

Thank you, intruder on the roof . Your sacrifice was not in vain .

"Oy Sebastian . How could a royal guard fall on his arse by a little intimidation from an intruder? You're going to die early like this . " A hooded augmenter holding a spear shook his head, trying to sound tough in front of his comrades .

"I merely slipped!" Sebastian snarled, slapping away the hand that one of the guards held out .

He regarded me suspiciously for a moment but said nothing else as he turned away in disdain .

"Now! For the final item we have up for the lucky individual fortunate enough to acquire this!" The auctioneer's dramatic voice echoed from below as another cage covered by a silky cloth was dragged onstage .

Everyone in the room was still noticeably tense from the initial shock of an intruder, but their attention was now focused back onto the stage after Vincent announced he had been killed .

After a dramatic pause, the tarp covering the cage was removed, revealing a small feline animal the size of a large dog .

The auctioneer bellowed at that exact moment, "An infant world lion! For those who are ignorant of this magnificent mana beast, an adult world lion has the capability to at least become a B-class mana beast . I dare say that if taken care of well, this infant world lion could even become an A-class mana beast! Do you know what this means? Taking care of and treasuring this fine beast will allow its master to become a legendary beast tamer!"

The audience below us erupted into a frenzy as hands shot into the air, bidding without even waiting for the auctioneer . To my surprise, King Glayder smacked the glass with his hand as his eyes stayed glued to the mana beast .

Having never traversed to the Beast Glades, I was intrigued by cub as well .

Sebastian walked over to the edge of the room as well to get a better view of the mana beast currently on display . However, he merely let out a dissatisfied snort before walking back, getting another greedy eyeful of Sylvie .

I normally wouldn't have minded someone becoming jealous of the fact that I had a bond, but it was obvious that Sebastian had intentions to try and take my bond away from me . Needless to say, my patience with his borderline perverted leering was growing increasingly thin . "Now, now! I won't be able to start the bidding until everyone gets settled!" The auctioneer shook his fingers with a satisfied grin plastered on his face as he waited for the crowd to sedate .

As the bidders all reluctantly settled, the auctioneer finally announced the starting bid . "We will start at one hundred gold!"

Back in Ashber, ten silver coins were more than enough to feed a family of four for a year . Of course, there were obviously luxury foods that totaled astronomical amounts, but simply by going off of that standard, one hundred silver coins, which amounted to a single gold coin, would be more than enough to feed a family of four for ten years .

Growing up in the humble outpost of a town, I had never realized how much money was truly spent by the affluent class .

Immediately, the price for the world lion soared . Soon, it passed four hundred gold and the bidders had no intention of stopping .

"500 gold!"

"550!"

"600!"

"700!"

"1000 gold coins!" the King bellowed into a voice-amplifying artifact .

Simply by hearing their king's voice, the crowd's incessant bidding stopped . It was obvious that, while there were plenty who could afford to bid higher, they were more debating on whether it was worth bidding against their own king .

It didn't seem fair once the King stepped in, but he at least had the decency to put up a high enough price .

After the auctioneer counted off, the price was eventually settled at a thousand gold coins or one white-gold tablet; something I'd only seen in books and pictures .

Vincent walked up to the King with his hand held out . "Seems like no one wants to bid against you, King Glayder," he congratulated .

"One white-gold tablet shouldn't be too unfair, right?" the King joked as he peered back down onto the stage, obviously excited .

"Thank you for the consideration," Vincent chuckled in defeat . "What are your plans with the new royal pet? Will you use it for yourself, or perhaps give it to your son?"

"While tempting it is for me to acquire a bond, I'm thinking of giving it to Curtis…" he said casually . "Of course, that all depends on how he does," he finished, patting his son's head .

"D-Dad!" Prince Curtis, whose face had visibly brightened at his father's first remark, stuttered out in worry .

Queen Priscilla, adding fuel to the fire, added, "Curtis, I remember you've been slacking off on your sword lessons . "

"Ah! Mom! That was supposed to be a secret!" The fierce-looking prince tugged on his mother's sleeve as his eyes switched been his mother and father .

"Mama, can I have a pet?" Ellie asked .

"Haha! I don't know . Mana beasts only want to be pets for nice ladies," my mom teased .

"Ellie is nice! Right, Brother?" She pulled on my sleeve, sending me out to battle on her behalf .

"Hmm? Who knows . " Shooting her an evil smile, I placed Sylvie on my sister's lap before she started crying .

The Tenth Anniversary event ended without any further commotion besides the one that I caused, and the guards escorted all of us back downstairs .

Upon reaching the storage room behind the stage, Vincent handed me a package wrapped in a black cloth . The items that the King purchased were being hauled to the carriage by some of the workers .

"Thank you . " I accepted it graciously .

"For everything you and your family has done for us, this is hardly enough," Vincent replied . "Arthur, we have some swords in the back if you want to take a look while you're here . They might not be anything special, but I'm sure you'll be able to find a solid sword to last you until your body finishes growing . "

"Oh! Are you planning on taking lessons with the sword?" The King inquired, putting a hand on his son's shoulder . "My boy has just started learning as well . Maybe you two can spar one day . "

"Swords are merely a hobby for me, Your Majesty . I would never hope to amount to the same level as your son," I replied, turning back to redeem Vincent's offer .

"Your Majesty, Prince Curtis would only become infected with bad habits if he began sparring with mere commoners," Sebastian's hissy voice rang .

As I turned back to retort, my father and the Twin Horns came into view .

"Ah, you guys are here! How did you enjoy the Auction?" my father exclaimed, picking up Ellie after showing his respects to the King and Queen .

My father pulled Vincent aside as he and the Twin Horns began debriefing about the event .

"Your Majesty . If I may have a word with you," I heard Sebastian say as he leaned closely to the King's ear .

After a few moments, King Glayder shot his royal guard an irritated glance, but let out a sigh .

As the two walked towards me, it was obvious what they had just discussed by the way Sebastian wasn't even looking at me, but instead, at my bond .

However, instead of talking to me, the King called upon my father .

The King smiled at him, but his eyes remained stern . "I never did catch your name . You must be this young boy's father, correct?" he affirmed rather than asked .

"My name is Reynolds Leywin and yes, that is the case . What might be the matter, Your Majesty?" my father replied, lowering himself slightly .

"Sebastian, here, has been a royal guard for a while now and has helped our family an uncountable amount of times . "

His voice stayed relaxed he spoke to my father, but the condescension in his tone was still apparent . "For the exemplary services he has provided me, and therefore the country, I do feel the need to reward him at times . You see; he has taken a fancy to your son's bond . I know it's not easy to sever a contract and I'm sure the boy has grown close to his little pet, but I would be more than willing hire a mage to take care of the contract and compensate you and your family for the troubles . "

"Y-Your Majesty," my father stuttered, caught by surprise by the severe request . Taking a glance at me, he turned back to the King . "I must apologize, Your Majesty . Neither I nor my wife had anything to do to with my son's bond . He had acquired it himself, so I cannot speak on my son's behalf on matters of his bond . "

"Hmm," the King turned his attention to my direction, regarding me loftily, and I suddenly realized that I was returning his gaze . He realized, then, that for the entirety of their conversation, I had been staring icily at him and his guard .

"Boy . Didn't your father teach you to lower your gaze when speaking to someone of your superior?" Sebastian snarled in disdain as he slammed the end of his metal staff to the ground .

"Sebastian, silence!" The King held up his hand . Besides the royal family and their guards, the King's request had caught the attention of the rest of my family as well as Vincent's .

"Hello, child . " The King approached, standing an arm's length away from me . "I'm sure you've just heard me speak to your father so I won't repeat myself . How about it? My royal armory would certainly have a sword befitting that of any aspiring knight . "

Not wanting to make a big commotion, I swallowed back the profanity that was itching to spew out of my mouth . "Thank you, Your Majesty, for your gracious offer, but I must refuse . A simple sword could never replace Sylvie . "

"How dare⎯"

"Sebastian!" King Glayder roared . Turning back to me, he spoke again with a much more impatient tone . "How about a trade then? The world lion cub that I just purchased for your bond?"

"Father!" Curtis scurried over to his father, pulling on his sleeve . "I thought the mana beast was mine?"

Ignoring his son, the King waited for my response .

"Perhaps I didn't make myself clear . I do not wish to give, sell or trade my bond," I reiterated, failing to mask the annoyed expression on my face .

"I have asked you twice, child, for a favor . Twice," he emphasized, his tone growing grave . "I will ask you once more; will you give me your bond?"

The air was tense as everyone's attention was directed at me . Sebastian gave me a menacing look from bloodshot eyes, just waiting to be released . The rest of the royal guards were on standby near the two, carefully observing the situation .

"Then let me ask you a question in response, Your Majesty . How much are you willing to sell your children to me?" I asked coolly, never batting an eye .

Thrown off-guard, the King wasn't able to respond to the seemingly random question . "You have asked me twice and I have rejected you both times, yet it seems your pride won't allow you to accept my refusal . You don't seem to be aware of what you were asking me, so I hoped to clarify using my question instead . How much money should I give you in return for your son or your daughter, King Glayder?" I rephrased, without wavering .

I heard the sharp whistle of a sword leaving its scabbard . "Insolent peasant! You dare insult the King and his family?" a guard roared as he charged at me before anyone had the chance to respond .
As the sword arced towards me, I noticed that it had a faint glow of mana surrounding it . Augmenting his sword to attack an eight-year-old… this guy really showed no tact . The hood covering the guard's face was blown back as he charged towards me, revealing a rugged veteran's furious expression .

Faces of horror could be seen clearly from those around us . The Twin Horns desperately tried to make their way towards the guard when they saw him attack me, to stop him from cleaving me in two . Even the King looked surprised at the unprecedented action of his guard, while the Queen had already frantically started reaching for her wand .

My eyes stayed focused on the guard that was about to swing down, but I was quite relaxed . Whether or not it was because he was angry, or because the training the royal guards received was mediocre, his attack was rushed and full of openings . I didn't even need to will mana into my body to deal with him . I took a step forward with my right foot as his sword swung down towards me, then reached up and grabbed the space on the grip of his sword between the cross-guard and his hand .

I proceeded to pivot on my right foot, using the momentum of his swing, while my body was parallel to the guard's . His reinforced sword whistled harmlessly through the empty space where I'd just been, creating a small fissure in the ground, and conversely embedding his sword in it . In one smooth movement, I quickly struck him in the jaw, which he hadn't bothered to guard with mana . The force of my upward punch, combined with his downward movement from his swing, created an impact much stronger than I'd expected . The guard only managed to let out a low grunt before he crumpled to the ground .

My attention immediately focused, then, to Sebastian . As I had expected, the dense fool was silently muttering a spell as his beady eyes locked intently with mine .

SEBASTIAN'S POV:

'That impudent brat! He needs to learn his place! When the King asks for something, it isn't a request; it's an order! How dare he not only refuse, but also reprimand our noble King! That brat doesn't deserve his equals contract! I personally come from a family of pure conjurers; elite mages capable of bending nature to their will . I don't have a contract with a beast at all! Yet, that brat has a beast that was capable enough to form an equals contract at such a young age! That means that the beast's level is least A class!' I couldn't help but grind my teeth in frustration .

'I'm the one that deserves the magnificent steed that that beast will grow to become! And yet, he refused me? He refused the King?'

"Insolent peasant! You dare insult the King and his family?" Harry let out a roar as he charged towards the brat, his sword brandished high up in the air .

'Yes! Kill that brat! I guess augmenters do have their uses at times . Hahaha! After that brat's dead, that black mana beast will rightfully be mine!'

Yet, before I could even start cheering for him, he'd been knocked out .

"…"

'What the hell? How did that useless, half-witted fool manage to knock himself out? Ugh… I guess I'll have to handle this brat by myself . ' As I began taking out my staff, I noticed the brat walking towards me .

I had to hold back a laugh . 'He's actually come towards me? Is he asking to die?' Well, I didn't really care at this point . That non-mage 'Vincent' was a close friend of the King, but I'll probably just get off with a light punishment for killing an insignificant brat .

Whatever bothersome punishment he served me would be well worth it after getting my hands on the brat's mana beast .

As I began silently chanting a spell, I couldn't help but grow irritated as he continued to approach me . Was he such a fool that he couldn't tell that he was about to die?

However, a twinge of unease began forming at the pit of my stomach . This boy, no background or power to save him, had such confidence . Why did I feel like this brat, who's only half my height, was somehow looking down at me; as if he was the one that was superior .

However, much stronger than my unease was harsh contempt for having something that I had been searching so hard for . 'You're just trying to make me want to kill you more, aren't you, brat?'

He arrived in front of me just as I was about to finish my Fire Spark spell .

All of a sudden, a piercing crunch sounded from beneath me before I dropped to my knees . " . . . "

'That's weird . Why did I suddenly lose balance?'

I glanced down, only to see someone's knee bent inwards, along with the bones, tendons still attached, sticking out of the skin .

'T-t-that's my leg!'

"GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!"

"M-MY LEG! MY LEG!! AHHHHHHHH!"

IT HURTS! IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURTS! I've never felt such excruciating pain in my life! Why should a noble conjurer like myself need to feel pain?

'W-Why is no-one helping me?' As I frantically looked around, it was apparent that everyone was somehow frozen . They weren't just surprised, but actually frozen in place .

It was then that I noticed that the colors of my surrounding had been flipped, or reversed . 'Have my eyes been clouded from the pain?'

"This space won't last long, so I'll make it quick . I'll tell you rightnow that it would be best for both of us if you stopped your hopeless pursuit of my bond . I don't wish to make an enemy of this Kingdom's leader, thus I'm giving you one last chance . "

The boy was speaking in a manner that made me completely forget his age . The tone of his words, coupled with the way he articulated them, carried both power and dignity, caused a terrifying sensation that I had felt before .

'It was him back in the room!' As I thought this, the pressure bore down on me, forcing me to fearfully comply .

He turned his back to me as he walked away, taking a few steps forward, before suddenly glancing back at me .

He looked at me with an emotionless face, his eyes seeming to pierce straight into my brain like a hot needle, actually making me wince in pain .

'No… No, no, no . . . I can't breathe! I-I'm scared!' The torturous pain had been somewhat numbed . Instead, I could feel a warm sensation between my legs as my body accepted its fate of death .

His eyes continued to bore down at me in blatant disgust as I tried to stop my body from shivering .

He looked at me as if I was simply an insect, and slowly mouthed,

"Know . Your . Place . "

KING GLAYDER'S POV:

While the implication of his message towards the King of a country was provoking, this eight-year-old's reasoning and argument fascinated me .

Even though Sebastian was a loyal guard that had served us for decades, it was beneath me to make this kid give up his pet . And yet, I still promised him beforehand that I would . Who would I be if I were to go back on my word?Then, everything went south . 'Do the Royal Knight Guards only amount to this much…? To rush in simply because of an eight-year-old's provocation?'

I didn't bring my personal Templar Knights, thinking that there wouldn't be any trouble, but I couldn't have guessed that these fresh trainees would cause this much trouble . . .

Although it surprised me, I quickly composed myself . What's done is done . If a royal guard was to kill this child, the public might pity him and his family for a couple of days, but ultimately the fault would lie in the child's parents for getting in my way .

It was a pity that this kid's family was friends with Vincent . Cutting ties with the auction house owner may turn out to be . . . a bit inconvenient, in the future .

Yet, outside of all expectations, the eight-year-old displayed a series of movements that couldn't be more impeccably executed even if a Tempar Knight had done it . So deftly did the boy knock out my Royal Guardsman .

'Harry, you fool . How inexperienced do you have to be that you even forgot to reinforce your body?! The only thing you're doing is give a bad name to the Royal Knights of Sapin!'

"KYYAAAAAAAAAA!" I instantly turned my head in the direction of the shrill scream .

My wife was staring wide-eyed at something behind me, causing me to turn around to get a better look .

'How is Sebastian, who was fine just a second ago, now on the ground clutching his left leg like that? His leg has several shards of bone sticking out, yet he's just glaring daggers at the boy?'

The conjurer fumbled for his staff on the ground and as soon as he grabbed it, pointed it at the boy while starting to mumble a spell .

"Enough, Sebastian!" I roared at him . Did this ignorant fool not know that all of this stemmed from his greed for a child's bond?

I grabbed his staff and snapped it in half . Sebastian just looked at me in shock—as if I'd betrayed him .

This pathetic ingrate…

"Stand down! This matter is over," I growled menacingly at him as we locked eyes .

'He is in the presence of a King! No matter how much he has gotten used to it, it's best that I remind him that I can end his life on a whim . '

As soon as I finished this thought, the boy fainted . His family and, what I can only assume were his friends, immediately rushed towards him . I sighed . 'Settling this incident will be rather tiring . '

I could see that the boy's family and friends were struggling not to lash out at me .

'How wise of them to know their place in front of their King . '

Thinking about the trouble this had caused, and what it will take to deal with it, I let out a deep breath .

"I imagine that that boy needs to be treated; please excuse yourselves so that we can settle this matter another time," I announced as I guided my wife and children outside, leaving the two pathetic clowns that I'd been foolish enough to once call Royal Knights to be picked up by his teammates . ARTHUR LEYWIN'S POV:

'Gah! My head!'

I pried open my eyes, curious as to where I was, but everything was blurry . As my vision slowly cleared, I carefully turned my head to the right and to the left .

It was my room .

"Kyu!" Sylvie woke up almost immediately and began licking my face . 'You're awake! You're awake!' she chirped, her tail wagging fiercely .

"Mmm . . . ? Oh, you're finally awake!" My mom had her head in her arms as she leaned on my bed .

"The doctor said that you probably fell unconscious from shock, and that you'd wake up soon . However, I didn't think 'soon' would be eight hours . " She ran her fingers gently through my hair, giving me a soft smile .

It was evident from her red eyes that she'd been crying for a while . A bitter taste filled my mouth in regret from making her worry again

"What happened after I passed out?" I willed myself to sit up, placing the excited Sylvie on my lap .

"We all left shortly after you fell unconscious . No one was in their right state of mind, thus the King excused himself first . Your father is downstairs with the King's representative . They're in the living room discussing what happened . " Her eyes quivered in worry .

I simply nodded in response and got out of bed . My body still felt heavy from using the first phase of Sylvia's Draconic Will, so I limped slowly downstairs with Mother after she checked in on Ellie, who was asleep in her room .

As we made our way downstairs, I could hear my father, along with an elderly man's hoarse voice .

Upon seeing me, the representative suddenly stood up, giving me a slight bow, a bit of a relieved look on his weathered face . My father's back was facing me, so he only turned to look when he saw the old man start to get up .

"My son! You're awake!" He hurled himself over the couch and wrapped me in a bear hug, his hand cupping the back of my head .

"Yeah Dad, I'm fine . What're you guys talking about?"

"This representative came by with a few gold coins as a 'token of apology' from the King . 'For the small incident'," my father answered through clenched teeth .

"The Royal King has also ordered me to inform the Leywin family that both guards that attacked Arthur Leywin have been stripped of nobility," the representative added, his voice cracking .

"For almost killing my son, the King just gave them a slap on the wrist, and then waved them goodbye?" My father couldn't help but be livid from the frustration .

"Father, it's all right! Look, I wasn't hurt . Let's just end this matter . " I squeezed my father's hand, giving him a reassuring look .

The King seemed like a decent enough character, but in times like this, I guess his priorities lie elsewhere .

The representative just looked at us matter-of-factly—as if it was a given that whatever the King had done was the right thing .

Letting out a sigh, I took a seat . 'I'm too tired for this crap . '

Casting aside the issue, I asked about Sebastian, in case he'd said anything . "What happened to that Conjurer? The one who had his knee broken?"

The representative just shook his head a little . "We don't know . Our experts hypothesized that it was due to the mana that the Knight attacked you with ricocheting and hitting his knee . "

I just shrugged at this . Looks like the matter was settled more easily than I had expected .

After the elderly representative left—mainly because my father had grown impatient with his attitude—he turned around and gave me a grin .

"Good job knocking out that Augmenter . That's my son!" He put his fist out in front of him, which I promptly pounded with my own fist, smiling .

"Where are the Twin Horns anyway? I thought they'd be here . "

My mother answered me while chuckling, "We had to keep them away from this, otherwise they might've really turned into wanted criminals . "

I laughed at this, but I could tell that it was something they were genuinely worried about by the helpless look on my father's face .

According to my mother, the Twin Horns were waiting at a nearby Inn . My father told me that we'd head out there tomorrow for breakfast, and would discuss me being an adventurer with them . I nodded at this and went back into my room . My birthday was in less than two weeks . I'd finally be able to make my first mark here in this world .

As I sunk back down in my bed, I stared at the palms of my hands, idly thinking about the events from earlier . This was the first time I'd used Sylvia's Draconic Will . These past years that I had spent studying Sylvie's will, before assimilating it into my body and practicing it for four months, had caused me to sigh in wonder at just how powerful Sylvia was .

I was just tapping into the ocean that was Sylvia's powers . Unlike Grandpa Virion, who could only get a speed boost and blend into his surroundings, being a legacy tamer allowed me to access a lot more of Sylvia's powers at stage one .

What I had used on Sebastian was something that I decided to named 'Distortion' . I could basically separate myself from time and space for a brief moment . Although I couldn't alter anything around me, it did give me time to assess my situation . Earlier today, I'd exceeded my limits by using Distortion on another person as well . This had allowed me to get by unnoticed from the King—for now . I wasn't strong enough to act against him yet .

My current limit with Distortion, before I received any backlash, was two seconds . However today, I had used it on another person, as well as had prolonged it to five seconds . I'd done all that just to scare that bug named Sebastian . I'd used up all of my mana and passed out for half a day—just to terrify a bug . Maybe it would've been better to kill him .

No, I couldn't think like that anymore . Causing meaningless deaths just for my convenience wasn't something that I should do in this world . I needed to be different in this world .

I shook my head . I had a lot of time . Since I had so much time, I needed to be patient .

I unwrapped the package that Vincent had left beside my bed, only to see a completely white mask that was able to cover my entire face . It was a simple mask, with two sharp eye slits that curved upwards; it reminded me of a fox's eyes . There was no nose or mouth hole; just a singular blue streak that ran straight down the left side of the mask, through the left eye slit .

I tried the mask on, which somehow stuck to my face without the need of a strap . I also tried on the midnight blue coat, which turned out to be a little long . After strapping on the coat, it suddenly shrunk to fit my body perfectly .

I couldn't help but be embarrassed; I felt like some sort of wannabe assassin or vigilante .

"Ahh, ahh . Testing . Testing . " The tone of my voice surprised me . It sounded completely different . My immature, high-pitched voice had become a rich, baritone .

"Kuu?" Sylvie just looked at me curiously, causing me to laugh and take off my getup .
