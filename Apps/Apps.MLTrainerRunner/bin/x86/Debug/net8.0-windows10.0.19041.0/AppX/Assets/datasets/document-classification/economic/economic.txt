The global financial crisis that began in 2007–2008 is generally described as the most serious crisis
of capitalism since the crash of 1929. The comparison is in some ways justified, but essential
differences remain. The most obvious of these is that the recent crisis has not led to a depression as
devastating as the Great Depression of the 1930s. Between 1929 and 1935, production in the
developed countries fell by a quarter, unemployment rose by the same amount, and the world did not
entirely recover from the Depression until the onset of World War II. Fortunately, the current crisis
has been significantly less cataclysmic. That is why it has been given a less alarming name: the Great
Recession. To be sure, the leading developed economies in 2013 are not quite back to the level of
output they had achieved in 2007, government finances are in pitiful condition, and prospects for
growth look gloomy for the foreseeable future, especially in Europe, which is mired in an endless
sovereign debt crisis (which is ironic, since Europe is also the continent with the highest
capital/income ratio in the world). Yet even in the depths of the recession, in 2009, production did
not fall by more than five percentage points in the wealthiest countries. This was enough to make it the
most serious global recession since the end of World War II, but it is still a very different thing from
the dramatic collapse of output and waves of bankruptcies of the 1930s. Furthermore, growth in the
emerging countries quickly bounced back and is buoying global growth today.
The main reason why the crisis of 2008 did not trigger a crash as serious as the Great Depression
is that this time the governments and central banks of the wealthy countries did not allow the financial
system to collapse and agreed to create the liquidity necessary to avoid the waves of bank failures
that led the world to the brink of the abyss in the 1930s. This pragmatic monetary and financial policy,
poles apart from the “liquidationist” orthodoxy that reigned nearly everywhere after the 1929 crash,
managed to avoid the worst. (Herbert Hoover, the US president in 1929, thought that limping
businesses had to be “liquidated,” and until Franklin Roosevelt replaced Hoover in 1933, they were.)
The pragmatic response to the crisis also reminded the world that central banks do not exist just to
twiddle their thumbs and keep down inflation. In situations of total financial panic, they play an
indispensable role as lender of last resort—indeed, they are the only public institution capable of
averting a total collapse of the economy and society in an emergency. That said, central banks are not
designed to solve all the world’s problems. The pragmatic policies adopted after the crisis of 2008
no doubt avoided the worst, but they did not really provide a durable response to the structural
problems that made the crisis possible, including the crying lack of financial transparency and the rise
of inequality. The crisis of 2008 was the first crisis of the globalized patrimonial capitalism of the
twenty-first century. It is unlikely to be the last.
Many observers deplore the absence of any real “return of the state” to managing the economy.
They point out that the Great Depression, as terrible as it was, at least deserves credit for bringing
about radical changes in tax policy and government spending. Indeed, within a few years of his
inauguration, Roosevelt increased the top marginal rate of the federal income tax to more than 80
percent on extremely high incomes, whereas the top rate under Hoover had been only 25 percent. By
contrast, at the time of this writing, Washington is still wondering whether the Obama administration
will be able in its second term to raise the top rate left by Bush (of around 35 percent) above what it
was under Clinton in the 1990s (around 40 percent).
In Chapter 14 I will look at the question of confiscatory tax rates on incomes deemed to be indecent
(and economically useless), which was in fact an impressive US innovation of the interwar years. To
my mind, it deserves to be reconceived and revived, especially in the country that first thought of it.
To be sure, good economic and social policy requires more than just a high marginal tax rate on
extremely high incomes. By its very nature, such a tax brings in almost nothing. A progressive tax on
capital is a more suitable instrument for responding to the challenges of the twenty-first century than a
progressive income tax, which was designed for the twentieth century (although the two tools can play
complementary roles in the future). For now, however, it is important to dispel a possible
misunderstanding.
The possibility of greater state intervention in the economy raises very different issues today than it
did in the 1930s, for a simple reason: the influence of the state is much greater now than it was then,
indeed, in many ways greater than it has ever been. That is why today’s crisis is both an indictment of
the markets and a challenge to the role of government. Of course, the role of government has been
constantly challenged since the 1970s, and the challenges will never end: once the government takes
on the central role in economic and social life that it acquired in the decades after World War II, it is
normal and legitimate for that role to be permanently questioned and debated. To some this may seem
unjust, but it is inevitable and natural. Some people are baffled by the new role of government, and
vehement if uncomprehending clashes between apparently irreconcilable positions are not uncommon.
Some are outspoken in favor of an even greater role for the state, as if it no longer played any role at
all, while still others call for the state to be dismantled at once, especially in the country where it is
least present, the United States. There, groups affiliated with the Tea Party call for abolishing the
Federal Reserve and returning to the gold standard. In Europe, the verbal clashes between “lazy
Greeks” and “Nazi Germans” can be even more vitriolic. None of this helps to solve the real
problems at hand. Both the antimarket and antistate camps are partly correct: new instruments are
needed to regain control over a financial capitalism that has run amok, and at the same time the tax
and transfer systems that are the heart of the modern social state are in constant need of reform and
modernization, because they have achieved a level of complexity that makes them difficult to
understand and threatens to undermine their social and economic efficacy.
This twofold task may seem insurmountable. It is in fact an enormous challenge, which our
democratic societies will have to meet in the years ahead. But it will be impossible to convince a
majority of citizens that our governing institutions (especially at the supranational level) need new
tools unless the instruments already in place can be shown to be working properly. To clarify all this,
I must first take a look backward and briefly discuss how taxation and government spending have
evolved in the rich countries since the nineteenth century.
The Growth of the Social State in the Twentieth Century
The simplest way to measure the change in the government’s role in the economy and society is to
look at the total amount of taxes relative to national income. Figure 13.1 shows the historical
trajectory of four countries (the United States, Britain, France, and Sweden) that are fairly
representative of what has happened in the rich countries. There are both striking similarities and
important differences in the observed evolutions.
$450,000, which corresponds to the average income of the top 2 percent of the US income
hierarchy. Such a finding does not seem entirely compatible with the idea of selection based solely
on merit. The contrast between the official meritocratic discourse and the reality seems particularly
extreme in this case. The total absence of transparency regarding selection procedures should also be
noted.
It would be wrong, however, to imagine that unequal access to higher education is a problem solely
in the United States. It is one of the most important problems that social states everywhere must face
in the twenty-first century. To date, no country has come up with a truly satisfactory response. To be
sure, university tuitions fees are much lower in Europe if one leaves Britain aside. In other
countries, including Sweden and other Nordic countries, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, tuition
fees are relatively low (less than 500 euros). Although there are exceptions, such as business schools
and Sciences Po in France, and although the situation is changing rapidly, this remains a very striking
difference between continental Europe and the United States: in Europe, most people believe that
access to higher education should be free or nearly free, just as primary and secondary education
are. In Quebec, the decision to raise tuition gradually from $2,000 to nearly $4,000 was interpreted
as an attempt to move toward an inegalitarian US-style system, which led to a student strike in the
winter of 2012 and ultimately to a change of government and cancellation of the decision.
It would be naïve, however, to think that free higher education would resolve all problems. In
1964, Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron analyzed, in Les héritiers, more subtle mechanisms
of social and cultural selection, which often do the same work as financial selection. In practice, the
French system of “grandes écoles” leads to spending more public money on students from more
advantaged social backgrounds, while less money is spent on university students who come from
more modest backgrounds. Again, the contrast between the official discourse of “republican
meritocracy” and the reality (in which social spending amplifies inequalities of social origin) is
extreme. According to the available data, it seems that the average income of parents of students at
Sciences Po is currently around 90,000 euros, which roughly corresponds to the top 10 percent of the
French income hierarchy. Recruitment is thus 5 times broader than at Harvard but still relatively
limited. We lack the data to do a similar calculation for students at the other grandes écoles, but the
results would likely be similar.
Make no mistake: there is no easy way to achieve real equality of opportunity in higher education.
This will be a key issue for the social state in the twenty-first century, and the ideal system has yet to
be invented. Tuition fees create an unacceptable inequality of access, but they foster the
independence, prosperity, and energy that make US universities the envy of the world. In the
abstract, it should be possible to combine the advantages of decentralization with those of equal
access by providing universities with substantial publicly financed incentives. In some respects this is
what public health insurance systems do: producers (doctors and hospitals) are granted a certain
independence, but the cost of care is a collective responsibility, thus ensuring that patients have equal
access to the system. One could do the same thing with universities and students. The Nordic
countries have adopted a strategy of this kind in higher education. This of course requires substantial
public financing, which is not easy to come by in the current climate of consolidation of the social
state. Such a strategy is nevertheless far more satisfactory than other recent attempts, which range
32

from charging tuition fees that vary with parents’ income to offering loans that are to be paid back
by a surtax added to the recipient’s income tax.
If we are to make progress on these issues in the future, it would be good to begin by working
toward greater transparency than exists today. In the United States, France, and most other countries,
talk about the virtues of the national meritocratic model is seldom based on close examination of the
facts. Often the purpose is to justify existing inequalities while ignoring the sometimes patent failures
of the current system. In 1872, Emile Boutmy created Sciences Po with a clear mission in mind:
“obliged to submit to the rule of the majority, the classes that call themselves the upper classes can
preserve their political hegemony only by invoking the rights of the most capable. As traditional
upper-class prerogatives crumble, the wave of democracy will encounter a second rampart, built on
eminently useful talents, superiority that commands prestige, and abilities of which society cannot
sanely deprive itself.” If we take this incredible statement seriously, what it clearly means is that the
upper classes instinctively abandoned idleness and invented meritocracy lest universal suffrage
deprive them of everything they owned. One can of course chalk this up to the political context: the
Paris Commune had just been put down, and universal male suffrage had just been reestablished. Yet
Boutmy’s statement has the virtue of reminding us of an essential truth: defining the meaning of
inequality and justifying the position of the winners is a matter of vital importance, and one can expect
to see all sorts of misrepresentations of the facts in service of the cause.
The Future of Retirement: Pay-As-You-Go and Low Growth
Public pension systems are generally pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) systems: contributions deducted from
the wages of active workers are directly paid out as benefits to retirees. In contrast to capitalized
pension plans, in a PAYGO system nothing is invested, and incoming funds are immediately
disbursed to current retirees. In PAYGO schemes, based on the principle of intergenerational
solidarity (today’s workers pay benefits to today’s retirees in the hope that their children will pay
their benefits tomorrow), the rate of return is by definition equal to the growth rate of the economy:
the contributions available to pay tomorrow’s retirees will rise as average wages rise. In theory, this
also implies that today’s active workers have an interest in ensuring that average wages rise as
rapidly as possible. They should therefore invest in schools and universities for their children and
promote a higher birth rate. In other words, there exists a bond among generations that in principle
makes for a virtuous and harmonious society.
When PAYGO systems were introduced in the middle of the twentieth century, conditions were in
fact ideal for such a virtuous series of events to occur. Demographic growth was high and
productivity growth higher still. The growth rate was close to 5 percent in the countries of continental
Europe, so this was the rate of return on the PAYGO system. Concretely, workers who contributed to
state retirement funds between the end of World War II and 1980 were repaid (or are still being
repaid) out of much larger wage pools than those from which their contributions were drawn. The
situation today is different. The falling growth rate (now around 1.5 percent in the rich countries and
perhaps ultimately in all countries) reduces the return on the pool of shared contributions. All signs
are that the rate of return on capital in the twenty-first century will be significantly higher than the
growth rate of the economy (4–5 percent for the former, barely 1.5 percent for the latter).
40
41

Under these conditions, it is tempting to conclude that the PAYGO system should be replaced as
quickly as possible by a capitalized system, in which contributions by active workers are invested
rather than paid out immediately to retirees. These investments can then grow at 4 percent a year in
order to finance the pensions of today’s workers when they retire several decades from now. There
are several major flaws in this argument, however. First, even if we assume that a capitalized system
is indeed preferable to a PAYGO system, the transition from PAYGO to capitalized benefits raises a
fundamental problem: an entire generation of retirees is left with nothing. The generation that is about
to retire, who paid for the pensions of the previous generation with their contributions, would take a
rather dim view of the fact that the contributions of today’s workers, which current retirees had
expected to pay their rent and buy their food during the remaining years of their lives, would in fact be
invested in assets around the world. There is no simple solution to this transition problem, and this
alone makes such a reform totally unthinkable, at least in such an extreme form.
Second, in comparing the merits of the two pension systems, one must bear in mind that the return
on capital is in practice extremely volatile. It would be quite risky to invest all retirement
contributions in global financial markets. The fact that r > g on average does not mean that it is true
for each individual investment. For a person of sufficient means who can wait ten or twenty years
before taking her profits, the return on capital is indeed quite attractive. But when it comes to paying
for the basic necessities of an entire generation, it would be quite irrational to bet everything on a roll
of the dice. The primary justification of the PAYGO system is that it is the best way to guarantee that
pension benefits will be paid in a reliable and predictable manner: the rate of wage growth may be
less than the rate of return on capital, but the former is 5–10 times less volatile than the latter. This
will continue to be true in the twenty-first century, and PAYGO pensions will therefore continue to be
part of the ideal social state of the future everywhere.
That said, it remains true that the logic of r > g cannot be entirely ignored, and some things may
have to change in the existing pension systems of the developed countries. One challenge is obviously
the aging of the population. In a world where people die between eighty and ninety, it is difficult to
maintain parameters that were chosen when the life expectancy was between sixty and seventy.
Furthermore, increasing the retirement age is not just a way of increasing the resources available to
both workers and retirees (which is a good thing in an era of low growth). It is also a response to the
need that many people feel for fulfillment through work. For them, to be forced to retire at sixty and to
spend more time in retirement in some cases than in a career, is not an appetizing prospect. The
problem is that individual situations vary widely. Some people have primarily intellectual
occupations, and they may wish to remain on the job until they are seventy (and it is possible that the
number of such people as a share of total employment will increase over time). There are many
others, however, who began work early and whose work is arduous or not very rewarding and who
legitimately aspire to retire relatively early (especially since their life expectancy is often lower than
that of more highly qualified workers). Unfortunately, recent reforms in many developed countries fail
to distinguish adequately between these different types of individual, and in some cases more is
demanded of the latter than of the former, which is why these reforms sometimes provoke strong
opposition.
One of the main difficulties of pension reform is that the systems one is trying to reform are
45
extremely complex, with different rules for civil servants, private sector workers, and nonworkers.
For a person who has worked in different types of jobs over the course of a lifetime, which is
increasingly common in the younger generations, it is sometimes difficult to know which rules apply.
That such complexity exists is not surprising: today’s pension systems were in many cases built in
stages, as existing schemes were extended to new social groups and occupations from the nineteenth
century on. But this makes it difficult to obtain everyone’s cooperation on reform efforts, because
many people feel that they are being treated worse than others. The hodgepodge of existing rules and
schemes frequently confuses the issue, and people underestimate the magnitude of the resources
already devoted to public pensions and fail to realize that these amounts cannot be increased
indefinitely. For example, the French system is so complex that many younger workers do not have a
clear understanding of what they are entitled to. Some even think that they will get nothing even though
they are paying a substantial amount into the system (something like 25 percent of gross pay). One of
the most important reforms the twenty-first-century social state needs to make is to establish a unified
retirement scheme based on individual accounts with equal rights for everyone, no matter how
complex one’s career path. Such a system would allow each person to anticipate exactly what to
expect from the PAYGO public plan, thus allowing for more intelligent decisions about private
savings, which will inevitably play a more important supplementary role in a low-growth
environment. One often hears that “a public pension is the patrimony of those without patrimony.”
This is true, but it does not mean that it would not be wise to encourage people of more modest means
to accumulate nest eggs of their own.
The Social State in Poor and Emerging Countries
Does the kind of social state that emerged in the developed countries in the twentieth century have a
universal vocation? Will we see a similar development in the poor and emerging countries? Nothing
could be less certain. To begin with, there are important differences among the rich countries: the
countries of Western Europe seem to have stabilized government revenues at about 45–50 percent of
national income, whereas the United States and Japan seem to be stuck at around the 30–35 percent
level. Clearly, different choices are possible at equivalent levels of development.
If we look at the poorest countries around the world in 1970–1980, we find that governments
generally took 10–15 percent of national income, both in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South Asia
(especially India). Turning to countries at an intermediate level of development in Latin America,
North Africa, and China, we find governments taking 15–20 percent of national income, lower than in
the rich countries at comparable levels of development. The most striking fact is that the gap between
the rich and the not-so-rich countries has continued to widen in recent years. Tax levels in the rich
countries rose (from 30–35 percent of national income in the 1970s to 35–40 percent in the 1980s)
before stabilizing at today’s levels, whereas tax levels in the poor and intermediate countries
decreased significantly. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the average tax bite was slightly
below 15 percent in the 1970s and early 1980s but fell to a little over 10 percent in the 1990s.
This evolution is a concern in that, in all the developed countries in the world today, building a
fiscal and social state has been an essential part of the process of modernization and economic
development. The historical evidence suggests that with only 10–15 percent of national income in tax

receipts, it is impossible for a state to fulfill much more than its traditional regalian responsibilities:
after paying for a proper police force and judicial system, there is not much left to pay for education
and health. Another possible choice is to pay everyone—police, judges, teachers, and nurses—
poorly, in which case it is unlikely that any of these public services will work well. This can lead to
a vicious circle: poorly functioning public services undermine confidence in government, which
makes it more difficult to raise taxes significantly. The development of a fiscal and social state is
intimately related to the process of state-building as such. Hence the history of economic development
is also a matter of political and cultural development, and each country must find its own distinctive
path and cope with its own internal divisions.
In the present case, however, it seems that part of the blame lies with the rich countries and
international organizations. The initial situation was not very promising. The process of
decolonization was marked by a number of chaotic episodes in the period 1950–1970: wars of
independence with the former colonial powers, somewhat arbitrary borders, military tensions linked
to the Cold War, abortive experiments with socialism, and sometimes a little of all three. After 1980,
moreover, the new ultraliberal wave emanating from the developed countries forced the poor
countries to cut their public sectors and lower the priority of developing a tax system suitable to
fostering economic development. Recent research has shown that the decline in government receipts
i n the poorest countries in 1980–1990 was due to a large extent to a decrease in customs duties,
which had brought in revenues equivalent to about 5 percent of national income in the 1970s. Trade
liberalization is not necessarily a bad thing, but only if it is not peremptorily imposed from without
and only if the lost revenue can gradually be replaced by a strong tax authority capable of collecting
new taxes and other substitute sources of revenue. Today’s developed countries reduced their tariffs
over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries at a pace they judged to be reasonable and
with clear alternatives in mind. They were fortunate enough not to have anyone tell them what they
ought to be doing instead. This illustrates a more general phenomenon: the tendency of the rich
countries to use the less developed world as a field of experimentation, without really seeking to
capitalize on the lessons of their own historical experience. What we see in the poor and emerging
countries today is a wide range of different tendencies. Some countries, like China, are fairly
advanced in the modernization of their tax system: for instance, China has an income tax that is
applicable to a large portion of the population and brings in substantial revenues. It is possibly in the
process of developing a social state similar to those found in the developed countries of Europe,
America, and Asia (albeit with specific Chinese features and of course great uncertainty as to its
political and democratic underpinnings). Other countries, such as India, have had greater difficulty
moving beyond an equilibrium based on a low level of taxation. In any case, the question of what
kind of fiscal and social state will emerge in the developing world is of the utmost importance for the
future of the planet.

Rethinking the Progressive Income Tax
In the previous chapter I examined the constitution and evolution of the social state, focusing on the
nature of social needs and related social spending (education, health, retirement, etc.). I treated the
overall level of taxes as a given and described its evolution. In this chapter and the next, I will
examine more closely the structure of taxes and other government revenues, without which the social
state could never have emerged, and attempt to draw lessons for the future. The major twentieth-
century innovation in taxation was the creation and development of the progressive income tax. This
institution, which played a key role in the reduction of inequality in the last century, is today seriously
threatened by international tax competition. It may also be in jeopardy because its foundations were
never clearly thought through, owing to the fact that it was instituted in an emergency that left little
time for reflection. The same is true of the progressive tax on inheritances, which was the second
major fiscal innovation of the twentieth century and has also been challenged in recent decades.
Before I examine these two taxes more closely, however, I must first situate them in the context of
progressive taxation in general and its role in modern redistribution.
The Question of Progressive Taxation
Taxation is not a technical matter. It is preeminently a political and philosophical issue, perhaps the
most important of all political issues. Without taxes, society has no common destiny, and collective
action is impossible. This has always been true. At the heart of every major political upheaval lies a
fiscal revolution. The Ancien Régime was swept away when the revolutionary assemblies voted to
abolish the fiscal privileges of the nobility and clergy and establish a modern system of universal
taxation. The American Revolution was born when subjects of the British colonies decided to take
their destiny in hand and set their own taxes. (“No taxation without representation”). Two centuries
later the context is different, but the heart of the issue remains the same. How can sovereign citizens
democratically decide how much of their resources they wish to devote to common goals such as
education, health, retirement, inequality reduction, employment, sustainable development, and so on?
Precisely what concrete form taxes take is therefore the crux of political conflict in any society. The
goal is to reach agreement on who must pay what in the name of what principles—no mean feat, since
people differ in many ways. In particular, they earn different incomes and own different amounts of
capital. In every society there are some individuals who earn a lot from work but inherited little, and
vice versa. Fortunately, the two sources of wealth are never perfectly correlated. Views about the
ideal tax system are equally varied.
One usually distinguishes among taxes on income, taxes on capital, and taxes on consumption.
Taxes of each type can be found in varying proportions in nearly all periods. These categories are not
exempt from ambiguity, however, and the dividing lines are not always clear. For example, the
income tax applies in principle to capital income as well as earned income and is therefore a tax on
capital as well. Taxes on capital generally include any levy on the flow of income from capital (such
as the corporate income tax), as well as any tax on the value of the capital stock (such as a real estate
tax, an estate tax, or a wealth tax). In the modern era, consumption taxes include value-added taxes as
well as taxes on imported goods, drink, gasoline, tobacco, and services. Such taxes have always
existed and are often the most hated of all, as well as the heaviest burden on the lower class (one
thinks of the salt tax under the Ancien Régime). They are often called “indirect” taxes because they do
not depend directly on the income or capital of the individual taxpayer: they are paid indirectly, as
part of the selling price of a purchased good. In the abstract, one might imagine a direct tax on
consumption, which would depend on each taxpayer’s total consumption, but no such tax has ever
existed.
In the twentieth century, a fourth category of tax appeared: contributions to government-sponsored
social insurance programs. These are a special type of tax on income, usually only income from labor
(wages and remuneration for nonwage labor). The proceeds go to social insurance funds intended to
finance replacement income, whether pensions for retired workers or unemployment benefits for
unemployed workers. This mode of collection ensures that the taxpayer will be aware of the purpose
for which the tax is to be used. Some countries, such as France, also use social contributions to pay
for other social spending such as health insurance and family allowances, so that total social
contributions account for nearly half of all government revenue. Rather than clarify the purpose of tax
collection, a system of such complexity can actually obscure matters. By contrast, other states, such as
Denmark, finance all social spending with an enormous income tax, the revenues from which are
allocated to pensions, unemployment and health insurance, and many other purposes. In fact, these
distinctions among different legal categories of taxation are partly arbitrary.
Beyond these definitional quibbles, a more pertinent criterion for characterizing different types of
tax is the degree to which each type is proportional or progressive. A tax is called “proportional”
when its rate is the same for everyone (the term “flat tax” is also used). A tax is progressive when its
rate is higher for some than for others, whether it be those who earn more, those who own more, or
those who consume more. A tax can also be regressive, when its rate decreases for richer individuals,
either because they are partially exempt (either legally, as a result of fiscal optimization, or illegally,
through evasion) or because the law imposes a regressive rate, like the famous “poll tax” that cost
Margaret Thatcher her post as prime minister in 1990.
In the modern fiscal state, total tax payments are often close to proportional to individual income,
especially in countries where the total is large. This is not surprising: it is impossible to tax half of
national income to finance an ambitious program of social entitlements without asking everyone to
make a substantial contribution. The logic of universal rights that governed the development of the
modern fiscal and social state fits rather well, moreover, with the idea of a proportional or slightly
progressive tax.
It would be wrong, however, to conclude that progressive taxation plays only a limited role in
modern redistribution. First, even if taxation overall is fairly close to proportional for the majority of
the population, the fact that the highest incomes and largest fortunes are taxed at significantly higher
(or lower) rates can have a strong influence on the structure of inequality. In particular, the evidence
suggests that progressive taxation of very high incomes and very large estates partly explains why the
1

concentration of wealth never regained its astronomic Belle Époque levels after the shocks of 1914–
1945. Conversely, the spectacular decrease in the progressivity of the income tax in the United States
and Britain since 1980, even though both countries had been among the leaders in progressive
taxation after World War II, probably explains much of the increase in the very highest earned
incomes. At the same time, the recent rise of tax competition in a world of free-flowing capital has
led many governments to exempt capital income from the progressive income tax. This is particularly
tr ue in Europe, whose relatively small states have thus far proved incapable of achieving a
coordinated tax policy. The result is an endless race to the bottom, leading, for example, to cuts in
corporate tax rates and to the exemption of interest, dividends, and other financial revenues from the
taxes to which labor incomes are subject.
One consequence of this is that in most countries taxes have (or will soon) become regressive at the
top of the income hierarchy. For example, a detailed study of French taxes in 2010, which looked at
all forms of taxation, found that the overall rate of taxation (47 percent of national income on average)
broke down as follows. The bottom 50 percent of the income distribution pay a rate of 40–45 percent;
the next 40 percent pay 45–50 percent; but the top 5 percent and even more the top 1 percent pay
lower rates, with the top 0.1 percent paying only 35 percent. The high tax rates on the poor reflect the
importance of consumption taxes and social contributions (which together account for three-quarters
of French tax revenues). The slight progressivity observed in the middle class is due to the growing
importance of the income tax. Conversely, the clear regressivity in the top centiles reflects the
importance at this level of capital income, which is largely exempt from progressive taxation. The
effect of this outweighs the effect of taxes on the capital stock (which are the most progressive of
all). All signs are that taxes elsewhere in Europe (and probably also in the United States) follow a
similar bell curve, which is probably even more pronounced than this imperfect estimate indicates.
If taxation at the top of the social hierarchy were to become more regressive in the future, the
impact on the dynamics of wealth inequality would likely be significant, leading to a very high
concentration of capital. Clearly, such a fiscal secession of the wealthiest citizens could potentially
do great damage to fiscal consent in general. Consensus support for the fiscal and social state, which
is already fragile in a period of low growth, would be further reduced, especially among the middle
class, who would naturally find it difficult to accept that they should pay more than the upper class.
Individualism and selfishness would flourish: since the system as a whole would be unjust, why
continue to pay for others? If the modern social state is to continue to exist, it is therefore essential
that the underlying tax system retain a minimum of progressivity, or at any rate that it not become
overtly regressive at the top.
Furthermore, looking at the progressivity of the tax system by examining how heavily top incomes
are taxed obviously fails to weigh inherited wealth, whose importance has been increasing. In
practice, estates are much less heavily taxed than income. This exacerbates what I have called
“Rastignac’s dilemma.” If individuals were classified by centile of total resources accrued over a
lifetime (including both earned income and capitalized inheritance), which is a more satisfactory
criterion for progressive taxation, the bell curve would be even more markedly regressive at the top
of the hierarchy than it is when only labor incomes are considered.
One final point bears emphasizing: to the extent that globalization weighs particularly heavily on
