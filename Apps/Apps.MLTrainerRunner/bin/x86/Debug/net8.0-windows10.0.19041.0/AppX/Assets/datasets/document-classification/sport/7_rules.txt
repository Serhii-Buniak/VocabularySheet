A moment so sublime they coined a phrase for it. "The Shot" refers to arguably the greatest basketball player in history, Michael Jordan, shooting arguably one of the most dramatic buzzer beaters in the history of the sport. His Chicago Bulls had been trailing the Cleveland Cavaliers for the entire duration of the fifth game of the first round of the NBA Playoffs; but with six seconds to go, a Jordan jumper put the Bulls in a 99-98 lead. Cleveland came back and it was 99-100 with 3.2 seconds to go. Let's go to commentator Jim Durham: 

Pete Rose's fall from grace was a bitter blow to baseball. The player known as "Charlie Hustle" was a legend with the most ever hits (4,256), games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053), and outs (10,328). He won three World Series rings, the same number of batting titles, the National League's Most Valuable Player Award in 1973, and made 17 All-Star appearances across an incredible (and unequalled) five positions.

But Rose finally wilted in the face of accusations that he gambled on baseball games while playing for and managing his beloved Cincinnati Reds. On August 24, he voluntarily accepted a permanent place on baseball's ineligible list. And by accepting that there was a factual reason for the ban, Major League Baseball agreed to make no formal finding regarding the gambling allegations. But the damage had been done and he must remain the greatest baseball talent not admitted to the Hall of Fame.

The end to a sporting season does not get more dramatic than this: Arsenal (best known back then for grinding out dull 1-0 wins) needed to win at Liverpool (best known back then for putting all teams to the sword via their scintillating style of play) by a two goal margin if they wanted to win the soccer league championship in England. A tight first half ended goalless. Pushing forward after the restart, striker Alan Smith nodded Arsenal into an improbable lead. But entering the final minute, they still needed that elusive second goal: launching a last ditch attack, the ball fell to midfielder Michael Thomas who calmly slotted it into the net as if he were playing in a practice match. "It's up for grabs now!" screamed the commentator as Thomas burst through. It certainly was.

The soccer world would be uprooted after Milan's drubbing of Real Madrid. Nobody beat Real by five goals. Yet the seeds of this stunning victory were surely sown three years earlier after future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi purchased the rossoneri. His masterstrokes were in appointing coach Arrigo Sacchi and sanctioning the transfers of the Dutch trio Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard. This resulted in one of the most successful sides in the club's history, as Milan won seven domestic titles, five European Cups and three Intercontinental Cups. They would even go 58 games unbeaten in the early 90s; on this special night, a small shift was felt with its ramifications felt for years to come.

Pinpointing the exact 'moment' for the purpose of this list from Australia's comprehensive thrashing of England during the Ashes cricket series of 1989 isn't difficult: it must be the nine wicket victory from the 4th test match at Old Trafford which signaled their regaining of the Ashes (for the first time on English soil since 1934). But that would do a disservice to the rest of their play over that summer. The away side set out their stall in the opening test by scoring more than 600 runs in the first inning and proceeded to batter England (with bat and ball) at every opportunity. The irony was that the Aussies had been comprehensively written off beforehand in the English press. It would take England's cricketers 16 years to wrest the Ashes back.

San Francisco's baseball team might have ultimately wound up losing finalists in 1989 but the mighty football juggernaut that was the 49ers continued to roll. A 20-16 Superbowl victory against the Cincinnati Bengals will always be best remembered for their game-winning drive. Behind by 16-13, San Francisco got the ball on their own eight yard line with 3:10 left on the clock in the fourth quarter and proceeded to march 92 yards down the field. They scored a touchdown thanks to the ever reliable combination of quarterback Joe Montana finding John Taylor with just 34 seconds left in the game.
